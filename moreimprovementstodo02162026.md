## Tier 2 — Medium-effort, high-value expansions

### D. Vendor Comparison & Procurement Matrix

**Targets:** Procurement teams, vendor evaluation

- Enhance Migrate module with side-by-side vendor comparison
- Add columns: TCO estimate, support tier, government certifications, migration complexity
- Filterable by industry vertical (finance, healthcare, defense)

### E. DevOps Integration Guides

**Targets:** Platform engineers, DevOps

- New `/guides` section with practical migration playbooks
- Topics: "Migrating TLS certificates to PQC", "Hybrid key exchange in nginx/envoy", "CI/CD crypto validation"
- Code snippets for OpenSSL CLI, Go, Python, Java, Rust

### F. Country-Specific Readiness Scorecards

**Targets:** Policy makers, government

- Enhance Timeline module with country-level filtering
- Show per-country compliance status (US/EU/JP/AU/etc.)
- Link to national cryptography agency recommendations

## Tier 3 — Larger effort, strategic expansions

### G. PQC for Blockchain Migration Path

**Targets:** Web3 developers, DeFi protocols

- Add quantum threat assessment for on-chain assets
- Show which chains have PQC roadmaps (Ethereum's account abstraction, etc.)
- Smart contract vulnerability scanner concept

### H. Industry Vertical Landing Pages

**Targets:** All verticals

- Create industry-specific landing pages: `/industry/finance`, `/industry/healthcare`, `/industry/defense`
- Curate existing timeline events, threats, and compliance data per vertical
- Custom hero messaging per industry
- SEO benefit: rank for "PQC for banking", "quantum-safe healthcare", etc.

### I. API & Embeddable Widgets

**Targets:** Developers, enterprises

- Expose timeline, compliance, and algorithm data as a REST/JSON API
- Embeddable widgets (compliance badge, algorithm comparison card)
