_FIPS 186-5 FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS PUBLICATION (Supersedes FIPS 186-4) Digital Signature Standard (DSS) CATEGORY: COMPUTER SECURITY SUBCATEGORY: CRYPTOGRAPHY Information Technology Laboratory National Institute of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8900 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.186-5 Published: February 3, 2023 U.S. Department of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo, Secretary National Institute of Standards and Technology Laurie E. Locascio, NIST Director and Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology FOREWORD The Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) series of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is the official series of publications relating to standards and guidelines developed under 15 U.S.C. 278g-3, and issued by the Secretary of Commerce under 40 U.S.C. 11331. Comments concerning FIPS publications are welcomed and should be addressed to the Director, Information Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive, Stop 8900, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8900. Charles H. Romine, Director Information Technology Laboratory Abstract This standard specifies a suite of algorithms that can be used to generate a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time.
