# Algorithm Identifiers for ML-DSA in X.509 PKI

## Authors

**Organization:** IETF LAMPS

## Scope

**Industries:** Gov; Finance; Web PKI; Identity
**Region:** International
**Document type:** PKI/Certificate

## How It Relates to PQC

PQ signatures in X.509 certificates

**Dependencies:** FIPS 204; RFC 5280

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** High

Introduction The Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) is a quantum-resistant digital signature scheme standardized by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC project [ NIST-PQC ] in [ FIPS204 ] . This document specifies the use of the ML-DSA in Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) at three security levels: ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87. ¶ [ FIPS204 ] defines two variants of ML-DSA: pure and pre-hash. Only the former is specified in this document. See Section 8.3 for the rationale. The pure variant of ML-DSA supports the typical pre-hash flow. Refer to Appendix D for more details. ¶ Prior to standardization, ML-DSA was known as Dilithium. ML-DSA and Dilithium are not compatible. ¶ 1.1.
