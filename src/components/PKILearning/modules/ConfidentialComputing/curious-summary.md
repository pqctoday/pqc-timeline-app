### What This Is About

Confidential Computing uses hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to protect Data-in-Use. Unlike standard volume encryption (Data-at-Rest) or TLS (Data-in-Transit), TEE enclaves encrypt data transparently within the processor's DRAM. This hardware isolation provides guarantees that even if the host operating system, hypervisor, or cloud administrator is fully compromised, code and data remain inaccessible from the outside.

### Why It Matters

Shor's and Grover's algorithms severely threaten the TEE trust model. Grover's algorithm halves symmetric security margins, downgrading current TEE memory encryption engines (AES-128-XTS) to an effective 64 bits. More critically, Shor's algorithm completely breaks Remote Attestation. Every major attestation quote today (Intel SGX/TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, ARM CCA) is signed using classical ECDSA (P-256/P-384). If an adversary forges these signatures via a quantum computer, they can easily impersonate an enclave and steal provisioned secrets from an HSM.

### The Key Takeaway

All attestation chains are currently quantum-vulnerable. Hardware vendors must rapidly upgrade CPU architectures to support AES-256 for memory encryption, while the ecosystem transitions Remote Attestation protocols to Post-Quantum signatures (ML-DSA) to guarantee trusted TEE-HSM communication.

### What's Happening

Hardware vendors are beginning to evaluate AES-256 upgrades for TEE memory encryption engines and exploring ML-DSA integration into Remote Attestation protocols, as the quantum threat to classical ECDSA attestation signatures across Intel SGX/TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and ARM CCA becomes increasingly urgent.
