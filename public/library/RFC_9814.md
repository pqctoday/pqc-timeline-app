# Use of SLH-DSA in CMS

## Authors

**Organization:** IETF LAMPS

## Scope

**Industries:** IT; Critical Infrastructure; Archival
**Region:** International
**Document type:** Protocol

## How It Relates to PQC

CMS signatures, S/MIME

**Dependencies:** FIPS 205; RFC 5652

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** Medium

RFC 9814 SLH-DSA Signature Algorithm in CMS July 2025 Housley, et al. Standards Track [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9814 Category: Standards Track Published: July 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: R. Housley Vigil Security S. Fluhrer Cisco Systems P. Kampanakis Amazon Web Services B. Westerbaan Cloudflare RFC 9814 Use of the SLH-DSA Signature Algorithm in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Abstract SLH-DSA is a stateless hash-based signature algorithm. This document specifies the conventions for using the SLH-DSA signature algorithm with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). In addition, the algorithm identifier and public key syntax are provided. ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

Introduction This document specifies the conventions for using the SLH-DSA hash-based signature algorithm [ FIPS205 ] with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [ RFC5652 ] signed-data content type. ¶ SLH-DSA offers two signature modes: pure mode and pre-hash mode. SLH-DSA signature operations include a context string as input. The context string has a maximum length of 255 bytes. By default, the context string is the empty string. This document only specifies the use of pure mode with an empty context string for the CMS signed-data content type. ¶ SLH-DSA offers three security levels. The parameters for each of the security levels were chosen to provide 128 bits of security, 192 bits of security, and 256 bits of security. Separate algorithm identifiers have been assigned for SLH-DSA at each of these security levels. ¶ SLH-DSA is a stateless hash-based signature algorithm. Other hash-based signature algorithms are stateful, including Hierarchical Signature System (HSS) / Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS) [ RFC8554 ] and eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) [ RFC8391 ] . Without the need for state kept by the signer, SLH-DSA is much less fragile than the stateful hash-based signature algorithms. ¶ 1.1. ASN.1 CMS values are generated with ASN.1 [ X680 ] using the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [ X690 ] . ¶ 1.2. Motivation There have been recent advances in cryptanalysis and advances in the development of quantum computers. Each of these advances pose a threat to widely deployed digital signature algorithms.
