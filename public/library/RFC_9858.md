# LMS Algorithm Identifiers for Alternative Hash Functions

## Authors

**Organization:** IETF CFRG

## Scope

**Industries:** Firmware; IoT
**Region:** International
**Document type:** Algorithm

## How It Relates to PQC

Extended LMS options

**Dependencies:** RFC 8554

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** Low

## PQC Key Types & Mechanisms

| Field                  | Value                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Algorithm family       | Hash-based (stateful)    |
| Security levels        | L1-L5                    |
| Protocol / tool impact | Extended LMS options     |
| Toolchain support      | Firmware implementations |

## Short Description

Extends RFC 8554 with SHA-3 and SHAKE hash function options for LMS.

RFC 9858 Additional HSS/LMS Signatures October 2025 Fluhrer & Dang Informational [Page] Stream: Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) RFC: 9858 Category: Informational Published: October 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: S. Fluhrer Cisco Systems Q. Dang NIST RFC 9858 Additional Parameter Sets for HSS/LMS Hash-Based Signatures Abstract This document extends HSS/LMS (RFC 8554) by defining parameter sets that use alternative hash functions. These include hash functions that result in signatures with significantly smaller sizes than the signatures that use the RFC 8554 parameter sets and should have sufficient security. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

Introduction Stateful hash-based signatures have small private and public keys, are efficient to compute, and are believed to have excellent security. One disadvantage is that the signatures they produce tend to be somewhat large (possibly 1-4 kilobytes). This document defines a set of parameter sets for the HSS/LMS stateful hash-based signature method [ RFC8554 ] that reduce the size of the signature significantly or rely on a hash function other than SHA-256 (to increase cryptodiversity). ¶ This document represents the consensus of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF. It is not an IETF product and is not a standard. ¶ According to official definitions and common usage, a Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) is a stateful hash-based signature scheme that is
