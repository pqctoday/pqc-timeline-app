_RFC 9802 HSS and XMSS for X.509 June 2025 Van Geest, et al. Standards Track [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9802 Category: Standards Track Published: June 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: D. Van Geest CryptoNext Security K. Bashiri BSI S. Fluhrer Cisco Systems S. Gazdag genua GmbH S. Kousidis BSI RFC 9802 Use of the HSS and XMSS Hash-Based Signature Algorithms in Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Abstract This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 encoding formats for the following stateful Hash-Based Signature (HBS) schemes: Hierarchical Signature System (HSS), eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), and XMSS MT (a multi-tree variant of XMSS). This specification applies to the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) when digital signatures are used to sign certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs). ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
