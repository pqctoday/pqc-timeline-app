    overview:
      'The Executive Quantum Impact module equips C-suite leaders, CISOs, and board members with the strategic context and decision-making tools needed to act on the quantum computing threat. It addresses the six most material business risks (HNDL data exposure, regulatory deadlines, board liability, vendor supply chain, competitive disadvantage, and cyber insurance gaps), provides a nine-criterion organizational self-assessment, and walks through building an actionable PQC migration roadmap framed ...',
    keyConcepts:
      'Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) — adversaries are recording encrypted traffic today to decrypt once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) arrives; data with long confidentiality requirements (health records, IP, state secrets) is already at risk regardless of the CRQC timeline; the HNDL window is the number of years remaining data must stay confidential minus years until a CRQC is available.',
    workshopSummary:
      'The workshop has 3 interactive steps: Threat Impact Explorer — six-panel executive briefing covering HNDL exposure (critical, already happening), regulatory deadline mapping (critical, 2025–2035), board and fiduciary liability (high, growing annually), vendor and supply chain risk (high, 2025–2028 assessment window), competitive disadvantage (medium, 2026–2030), and rising cyber insurance costs (medium, 2026–2030); each panel includes an example scenario illustrating the business impact.',
