## Authors

**Organization:** CISA/NSA

## Scope

**Industries:** Federal Government; Critical Infrastructure
**Region:** US Federal
**Document type:** Guidance

## How It Relates to PQC

Federal procurement; PQC product acquisition

**Dependencies:** FIPS 203; FIPS 204; FIPS 205; EO 14306

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** High
