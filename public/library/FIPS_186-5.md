# Digital Signature Standard (DSS)

## Authors

**Organization:** NIST

## Scope

**Industries:** IT; Finance; Gov; Web PKI
**Region:** USA; Global
**Document type:** Algorithm

## How It Relates to PQC

TLS, CMS, PKI, code signing

**Dependencies:** PKCS#1; EdDSA RFCs

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** Medium

FIPS 186-5 FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS PUBLICATION (Supersedes FIPS 186-4) Digital Signature Standard (DSS) CATEGORY: COMPUTER SECURITY SUBCATEGORY: CRYPTOGRAPHY Information Technology Laboratory National Institute of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8900 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.186-5 Published: February 3, 2023 U.S. Department of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo, Secretary National Institute of Standards and Technology Laurie E. Locascio, NIST Director and Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology FOREWORD The Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) series of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is the official series of publications relating to standards and guidelines developed under 15 U.S.C. 278g-3, and issued by the Secretary of Commerce under 40 U.S.C. 11331. Comments concerning FIPS publications are welcomed and should be addressed to the Director, Information Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive, Stop 8900, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8900. Charles H. Romine, Director Information Technology Laboratory Abstract This standard specifies a suite of algorithms that can be used to generate a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. Keywords: computer security; cryptography; digital signatures; Federal Information Processing Standards; public key cryptography. FIPS 186-5 DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD (DSS) Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 186-5 Published: February 3, 2023 Effective: February 3, 2023 (see the Implementation Schedule) Announcing the DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD (DSS) Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS) are developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under 15 U.S.C. 278g-3, and issued by the Secretary of Commerce under 40 U.S.C. 11331. 1. Name of Standard: Digital Signature Standard (DSS) (FIPS 186-5). 2. Category of Standard: Computer Security. Subcategory. Cryptography. 3. Explanation: This standard specifies algorithms for applications requiring a digital signature rather than a written signature. A digital signature is represented in a computer as a string of bits and computed using a set of rules and parameters that allow the identity of the signatory and the integrity of the data to be verified. Digital signatures may be generated on both stored and transmitted data. Signature generation uses a private key to generate a digital signature; signature verification uses a public key that corresponds to but is not the same as the private key. Each signatory possesses a private and public key pair. Public keys may be known by the public; private keys must be kept secret. Anyone can verify the signature by employing the signatory’s public key. Only the user that possesses the private key can perform signature generation. A hash function is often used in the signature generation process to obtain a condensed version of the data to be signed; the condensed version of the data is often called a message digest. The message digest is input to the digital signature algorithm to generate the digital signature. The hash functions to be used are specified in FIPS 180, Secure Hash Standard (SHS), and FIPS 202, SHA3: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions. FIPS-approved digital signature algorithms shall be used with appropriate approved functions (e.g., hash functions such as those specified in FIPS 180 or FIPS 202). The digital signature is provided to the intended verifier along with the signed data. The verifying entity verifies the signature by using the claimed signatory’s public key and the same hash function
