# Use of the HSS/LMS Hash-Based Signature Algorithm in CMS

## Authors

**Organization:** IETF LAMPS

## Scope

**Industries:** Firmware; Critical Infrastructure
**Region:** International
**Document type:** Protocol

## How It Relates to PQC

CMS signatures for firmware

**Dependencies:** RFC 8554; SP 800-208

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** Medium

Introduction This document specifies the conventions for using the Hierarchical Signature System (HSS) / Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) hash-based signature algorithm with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [ CMS ] signed-data content type. The LMS system provides a one-time digital signature that is a variant of the Merkle Tree Signature (MTS) scheme. The HSS is built on top of the LMS system to efficiently scale for a larger number of signatures. The HSS/LMS algorithm is one form of hash-based digital signature, and it is described in [ HASHSIG ] . The HSS/LMS signature algorithm can only be used for a fixed number of signing operations with a given private key, and the number of signing operations depends upon the size of the tree. The HSS/LMS signature algorithm uses small public keys, and it has low computational cost; however, the signatures are quite large. The HSS/LMS private key can be very small when the signer is willing to perform additional computation at signing time; alternatively, the private key can consume additional memory and provide a faster signing time. The HSS/LMS signatures are defined in [ HASHSIG ] . Currently, parameter sets are defined that use SHA-256 [ SHS ] and SHAKE256 [ SHA3 ] . ¶ 1.1. ASN.1 CMS values are
