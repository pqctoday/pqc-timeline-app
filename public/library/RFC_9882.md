# Use of ML-DSA in CMS

## Authors

**Organization:** IETF LAMPS

## Scope

**Industries:** Email; Messaging; JAR signing; Document Signing
**Region:** International
**Document type:** Protocol

## How It Relates to PQC

CMS signatures

**Dependencies:** FIPS 204; RFC 5652

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** High

RFC 9882 ML-DSA in the CMS October 2025 Salter, et al. Standards Track [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9882 Category: Standards Track Published: October 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: B. Salter UK National Cyber Security Centre A. Raine UK National Cyber Security Centre D. Van Geest CryptoNext Security RFC 9882 Use of the ML-DSA Signature Algorithm in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Abstract The Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), as defined by NIST in FIPS 204, is a post-quantum digital signature scheme that aims to be secure against an adversary in possession of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). This document specifies the conventions for using the ML-DSA signature algorithm with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). In addition, the algorithm identifier syntax is provided. ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

Introduction The Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) is a post-quantum digital signature algorithm standardised by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as part of their post-quantum cryptography standardisation process. It offers smaller signatures and significantly faster runtimes than SLH-DSA [ FIPS205 ] , an alternative post-quantum signature algorithm also standardised by NIST. This document specifies the use of ML-DSA in the CMS at three security levels: ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87. See Appendix B of [ RFC9881 ] for more information on the security levels and key sizes of ML-DSA. ¶ Prior to standardisation, ML-DSA was known as Dilithium. ML-DSA and Dilithium are not compatible. ¶ For each of the ML-DSA parameter sets, an algorithm identifier OID has been specified. ¶ [ FIPS204 ] also specifies a pre-hashed variant of ML-DSA, called HashML-DSA. Use of HashML-DSA in the CMS is not specified in this document. See Section 3.1 for more details. ¶ 1.1. Conventions and Definitions The key words " MUST ", " MUST NOT ", " REQUIRED ", " SHALL ", " SHALL NOT ", " SHOULD ", " SHOULD NOT ", " RECOMMENDED ", " NOT RECOMMENDED ", " MAY ", and " OPTIONAL " in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
