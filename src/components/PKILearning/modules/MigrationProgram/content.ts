    overview:
      'The Migration Program Management module teaches executives how to plan, execute, and track a PQC migration program at enterprise scale. It covers roadmap building with milestone planning overlaid on real country and compliance deadlines, stakeholder communication planning with audience-specific messaging frameworks, and KPI tracking for measuring migration progress.',
    keyConcepts:
      'NIST 7-Phase Migration Framework — Discovery, Inventory, Prioritization, Planning, Pilot, Migration, Validation; the recommended phased approach to PQC transition. Migration Roadmap — Gantt-style timeline with organizational milestones overlaid on external compliance deadlines (CNSA 2.0, NIST, EU/ANSSI); enables gap analysis between planned milestones and regulatory requirements.',
    workshopSummary:
      'The workshop has 3 interactive steps: Roadmap Builder — interactive timeline planner with draggable milestones overlaid on country-specific compliance deadlines; default milestones for crypto inventory, TLS pilot, and full migration; exports as Markdown. Stakeholder Communications Planner — 4-section artifact builder covering stakeholder map, message framework (per audience), communication cadence, and escalation criteria; produces a structured communications plan document.',
