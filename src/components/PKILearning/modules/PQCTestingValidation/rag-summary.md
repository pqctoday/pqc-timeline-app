# PQC Network Testing & Validation — RAG Summary

## Module Overview

**Module ID**: `pqc-testing-validation`
**Track**: Protocols
**Duration**: 120 minutes
**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Prerequisites**: hybrid-crypto, network-security-pqc, vpn-ssh-pqc (recommended)

This module teaches how to design and execute testing strategies for post-quantum cryptography deployments. It covers the full PQC testing lifecycle from initial crypto discovery through production monitoring — distinct from protocol migration modules which cover _what_ to migrate.

## Why PQC Testing Is Different

PQC testing introduces challenges absent from classical cryptography assessments:

1. **Algorithm size explosion** — ML-KEM public keys (1,184B), ciphertexts (1,088B), and ML-DSA signatures (3,293B) are orders of magnitude larger than ECDH/ECDSA equivalents. This causes TCP fragmentation, ClientHello oversize, and certificate chain size issues that standard TLS testing tools miss.

2. **Hybrid scheme complexity** — Testing hybrid PQC (X25519+ML-KEM-768) requires validating that both the classical and PQC components complete successfully. RFC 9794 prohibits silent downgrade — if either component fails, the shared secret is invalid.

3. **Side-channel failure modes are different** — Classical TVLA (fixed-vs-random) fails for lattice-based PQC because public keys and ciphertexts are structurally coupled, making fixed test vectors trivially distinguishable. NTT/INTT, polynomial multiplication, and modular reduction are the actual leakage targets.

4. **OT/ICS safety constraints** — Active scanning in OT environments can trigger safety system faults. Only passive-mode tools (CryptoNext COMPASS, pqc-flow in read-only mode) are appropriate for initial OT crypto inventory.

## Passive vs Active Discovery

**Passive discovery** inspects network traffic on SPAN ports or network taps without injecting packets. Tools observe:

- TLS ClientHello cipher suite extensions (hybrid KEM identifiers)
- Server certificate algorithm (RSA, ECDSA, or ML-DSA)
- SSH key exchange algorithm negotiation
- IKEv2 Key Exchange payload algorithm identifiers

Key limitation: passive tools can only detect algorithms in _current_ flows. If no ML-KEM-capable connection is being made, ML-KEM support cannot be detected passively.

**Tools**: CryptoNext COMPASS (commercial, NIST NCCoE recommended, NIST CAVP certified for all 3 PQC standards), pqc-flow (open source, CipherIQ), VIAVI Observer Analyzer (commercial, PQC detection in development).

**Active scanning** initiates TLS/SSH/IKEv2 connections to probe which algorithms an endpoint supports. Provides complete algorithm support matrix but generates detectable connection attempts — requires security operations coordination.

**Tools**: pqcscan (Anvil Secure, open source, Rust, BSD license), CryptoLyzer (community, multi-protocol), SSLyze (open source).

## PQC Performance Benchmarking Methodology

Key insight: **TCP-to-TLS overhead dominates, not crypto computation.** On a WAN link with 50ms RTT, the TCP handshake adds 6 RTTs (300ms) before any crypto begins. ML-KEM key generation adds ~0.7ms — negligible. The real cost is message size.

### Critical benchmark data (from VIAVI TeraVM + PQC-LEO):

| Metric               | Classical | Hybrid PQC   | Pure PQC           |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| TLS handshake (WAN)  | 68ms      | 82ms (+21%)  | 95ms (+40%)        |
| IKEv2 SA setup (WAN) | 240ms     | 380ms (+58%) | 12,626ms (+5,161%) |
| Certificate size     | 1.2KB     | 4.8KB        | 17.2KB             |
| ClientHello size     | 320B      | 1,120B       | 1,536B             |
| Throughput (WAN)     | 100%      | 87%          | 79%                |

The IKEv2 pure-PQC cliff (53×) makes hybrid the mandatory first step for VPN gateways. Pure-PQC TLS is more manageable (1.4× overhead on WAN).

**TCP fragmentation threshold**: ClientHello >~1,400 bytes triggers TCP fragmentation, adding exactly 1 RTT per connection. Pure PQC (1,536B) always fragments on standard Ethernet MTU.

**Tools**: VIAVI TeraVM (commercial, VPN benchmarking), PQC-LEO (open source, all NIST algorithms, x86+ARM), Keysight CyPerf (freemium, TLS, Community Edition free).

## Interoperability Testing & RFC 9794 Compliance

RFC 9794 (IETF, 2025) defines hybrid scheme design rules:

1. Both classical and PQC components must run to completion
2. Shared secret = KDF(classical_secret ∥ pqc_secret)
3. At least one algorithm must be shared between peers
4. Silent downgrade on failure is prohibited

### Real-world interoperability status (as of 2025):

| Client                | OQS Server | Cloudflare                         | Legacy TLS 1.2     |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Chrome 130+ (hybrid)  | Compatible | Compatible                         | Partial (fallback) |
| Firefox 128+ (hybrid) | Compatible | Compatible                         | Partial (fallback) |
| Pure PQC client       | Compatible | **Incompatible** (RFC 9794 policy) | **Incompatible**   |
| Classical-only        | Partial    | Partial                            | Compatible         |

**Oversized ClientHello risk**: Pure PQC ClientHellos (1,536B) exceed TCP MSS on some network devices — load balancers and firewalls may silently drop fragmented ClientHellos.

**Test infrastructure**: test.openquantumsafe.org (OQS Test Server, free public access, all NIST algorithm combinations available on separate ports).

## Side-Channel Testing & TVLA for Lattice Crypto

### Why TVLA is different for PQC

Classical fixed-vs-random TVLA divides measurements into "fixed plaintext" and "random plaintext" groups, then uses Welch's t-test to detect key-dependent power differences. For ML-KEM/ML-DSA, this approach fails: the public key and ciphertext are mathematically coupled, so a fixed ciphertext always uses the same secret polynomial — making the groups trivially distinguishable regardless of implementation quality.

**Correct approach**: Target specific algorithmic stages:

- **NTT/INTT** (Number Theoretic Transform) — primary leakage point in both ML-KEM and ML-DSA
- **Polynomial multiplication** — coefficient-wise multiplication in the Zq ring; leaks nonce information in ML-DSA signing
- **Modular reduction** — conditional subtraction for q=3329 (ML-KEM); leaks in unmasked implementations

**TVLA threshold**: |t| > 4.5 (NIST standard) indicates statistically significant leakage. |t| > 3.0 is used in strict evaluations.

### Implementation comparison:

| Stage                | ML-KEM (unmasked) | ML-KEM (1st-order masked) | ML-DSA (unmasked) | ML-DSA (masked) |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| NTT/INTT             | 12.7 (LEAKS)      | 3.4 (safe)                | 14.8 (LEAKS)      | 3.1 (safe)      |
| Poly. multiplication | 9.1 (LEAKS)       | 2.8 (safe)                | 11.3 (LEAKS)      | 5.9 (LEAKS)     |
| Modular reduction    | 7.8 (LEAKS)       | 1.9 (safe)                | 3.1 (safe)        | 1.3 (safe)      |

First-order masking eliminates NTT leakage but ML-DSA polynomial multiplication still leaks under masking (higher-order attack required).

**Tools**: Keysight Inspector Crypto 3 (commercial, Dilithium TVLA generator, Known Key Analysis, FIPS 140-3 Level 4 support), ChipWhisperer (open source, NewAE Technology, power analysis + fault injection).

## Test Strategy by Phase & Environment

### Phase 1: Inventory

Focus: Discover and classify all crypto assets. Tools: passive discovery + CBOM generation.

### Phase 2: Lab Testing

Focus: Validate PQC performance overhead and interoperability before production exposure.

### Phase 3: Pilot Rollout

Focus: Limited production deployment (5–10% of traffic/devices) with continuous monitoring.

### Phase 4: Full Production

Focus: Enterprise-wide enforcement, continuous compliance scanning, policy automation.

### Environment-specific constraints:

- **Enterprise**: Full toolset available; start with passive network scan, then active endpoint scan
- **Cloud-native**: CBOM first (CBOMkit), then service mesh PQC validation (Keysight CyPerf)
- **OT/ICS**: Passive-only during inventory phase (active probing can trigger safety faults); 4–8 week isolated pilot
- **Embedded/IoT**: TVLA side-channel testing before firmware deployment; OTA update integrity via ML-DSA
