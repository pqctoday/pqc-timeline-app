### What This Is About

IT Operations and DevOps teams deploy, monitor, and maintain the cryptography that protects the organization. The PQC migration is fundamentally an operations challenge, encompassing certificate rotation, VPN IPsec tunnels, SSH key management, and CI/CD pipeline deployments.

### Why It Matters

Because PQC certificates are 10-50x larger, automated lifecycle management tools (like cert-manager or ACME) configured for tiny ECDSA certificates often exceed their size limits and fail silently. Furthermore, the different performance profiles of PQC algorithms will trigger thousands of false-positive latency alerts if monitoring baselines and SLAs are not properly recalibrated.

### The Key Takeaway

Operations teams are on the front line of the quantum transition. They must immediately inventory all cryptographic assets, lab-test PQC protocols (like OpenSSH 9.x hybrid key exchanges), and update deployment playbooks before executing automated, phased rollovers.

### What's Happening

Operations teams are establishing PQC lab environments to test hybrid protocol deployments—including OpenSSH 9.x hybrid key exchanges—and recalibrating monitoring baselines to account for the larger certificate sizes and different latency profiles of quantum-safe algorithms.
