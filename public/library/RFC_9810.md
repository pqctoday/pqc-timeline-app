# Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) Updates for KEM

## Authors

**Organization:** IETF LAMPS

## Scope

**Industries:** PKI; Enterprise CA; IoT
**Region:** International
**Document type:** Protocol

## How It Relates to PQC

PKI certificate management with PQC

**Dependencies:** RFC 9629; FIPS 203

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** Medium

## Long Description

RFC 9810 CMP July 2025 Brockhaus, et al. Standards Track [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9810 Obsoletes: 4210 , 9480 Updates: 5912 Category: Standards Track Published: July 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: H. Brockhaus Siemens D. von Oheimb Siemens M. Ounsworth Entrust J. Gray Entrust RFC 9810 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure -- Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) Abstract This document describes the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificate Management Protocol (CMP). Protocol messages are defined for X.509v3 certificate creation and management. CMP provides interactions between client systems and PKI components such as a Registration Authority (RA) and a Certification Authority (CA). ¶ This document adds support for management of certificates containing a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) public key and uses EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue. This document also includes the updates specified in Section 2 and Appendix A.2 of RFC 9480. ¶ This document obsoletes RFC 4210, and together with RFC 9811, it also obsoletes RFC 9480. Appendix F of this document updates Section 9 of RFC 5912. ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It represents the consensus of the IETF community. It has received public review and has been approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). Further information on Internet Standards is available in Section 2 of RFC 7841. ¶ Information about the current status of this document, any errata, and how to provide feedback on it may be obtained at https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9810 . ¶ Copyright Notice Copyright (c) 2025 IETF Trust and the persons identified as the document authors.
