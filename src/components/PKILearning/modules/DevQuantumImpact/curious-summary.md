### What This Is About

Cryptography is no longer a set-and-forget implementation detail. Every line of cryptographic code you ship today—from JWT signing to TLS configuration—uses algorithms that quantum computers will break. Understanding Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is now a core engineering skill, as major libraries like OpenSSL 3.5, BoringSSL, and Go 1.24 are already actively rolling out PQC support.

### Why It Matters

PQC algorithms are not drop-in replacements. ML-KEM public keys are massive (up to 1568 bytes compared to ECC's 32 bytes), and ML-DSA signatures are enormous (up to 4627 bytes compared to ECDSA's 64). These size increases will instantly break assumptions baked into your application: HTTP headers will overflow, browser URL limits will be exceeded, TLS client hello messages will fragment and timeout, and your CI/CD pipelines will fail verification.

### The Key Takeaway

Developers must immediately audit their codebases to locate hardcoded algorithms and cipher suites. The critical path forward is building "Crypto Agility"—implementing abstraction layers that allow the application to swap cryptographic algorithms without requiring a total code rewrite.

### What's Happening

Major cryptographic libraries are already shipping PQC support—OpenSSL 3.5, BoringSSL, and Go 1.24 include ML-KEM and ML-DSA implementations—giving developers the tools to begin integrating quantum-safe algorithms into their applications today.
