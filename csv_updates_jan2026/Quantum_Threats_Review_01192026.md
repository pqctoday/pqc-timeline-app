## 2025-2026 Threat Intelligence Cross-Validation

### **IBM Quantum-Safe Readiness Index 2025**

- **Organization average score**: 25/100 (extremely low)
- **Quantum-Safe Champions** (top 10%): 35-50/100
- **Skill gap**: Organizations possess only 2/3 of necessary PQC expertise
- **Cryptographic inventory**: 70% have not completed full assessment
- **Vendor reliance**: 62% incorrectly assume vendors will handle transition

**Status**: These findings align with existing entries FIN-011, THREAT-FIN-127, and THREAT-HSM-126.

---

### **PQShield 2025 Industry Vulnerability Analysis**

Key vulnerable areas identified:

- Government/Defense (high priority for early PQC adoption)
- Supply chains (cryptographic component compliance)
- Financial transactions and hardware infrastructure
- Authentication methods (PKI, SSO, MFA)
- VPNs and key management systems

**Status**: Comprehensive coverage exists in GOV-001 through GOV-010, FIN-001 through FIN-127, and IT-001 through IT-007.

---

### **NSA CNSA 2.0 Timeline (2025-2035)**

Critical milestones for National Security Systems:

- **2025**: No mandates yet; support and preference encouraged
- **2027**: All new NSS acquisitions must be CNSA 2.0 compliant
- **2030**: Deployed software/firmware must use CNSA 2.0 signatures
- **2031**: Quantum-resistant algorithms broadly required
- **2033**: Web/cloud/OS must exclusively use CNSA 2.0
- **2035**: Complete NSS transition to quantum-resistant cryptography

**Status**: GOV entries correctly reflect these timelines and requirements.

## New Threat Intelligence - Potential Additions

While the current file is comprehensive, the following **emerging threat vectors** from 2025-2026 research could be considered for future updates:

### 🆕 Potential New Entries:

#### **1. Quantum-Safe Readiness Gap (Cross-Industry)**

- **Threat ID**: CROSS-001
- **Description**: Organizations score average 25/100 on quantum readiness; 70% lack complete cryptographic inventory creating massive vulnerability window. IBM estimates 5-6 year gap between CRQC arrival and organizational readiness.
- **Criticality**: HIGH
- **Source**: IBM Quantum-Safe Readiness Index 2025
- **Accuracy**: 100%

#### **2. Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) Timeline Acceleration**

- **Threat ID**: CROSS-002
- **Description**: Expert consensus shifting toward earlier CRQC arrival (2026-2030 range vs. previous 2030-2035 estimates). Some research indicates quantum advantage by end of 2026 for specific use cases.
- **Criticality**: CRITICAL
- **Source**: IBM Research / PQShield Analysis 2025
- **Accuracy**: 30%

#### **3. Authentication Infrastructure Quantum Vulnerability**

- **Threat ID**: IT-009
- **Description**: Modern authentication (digital certificates SSO platforms MFA devices) rely on quantum-vulnerable PKI. Migration to PQC-compatible certificate chains essential but lagging across enterprises.
- **Criticality**: HIGH
- **Source**: PQShield Government/Defense Analysis 2025
- **Accuracy**: 50%
