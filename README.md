    Learn, Timeline, Threats, About) remain accessible to all. Each persona's nav is tuned:
    Executive includes Compliance and Migrate; Developer includes Assess; Architect includes
    Playground
  - **"For you" badges**: landing page cards highlight the top 3 recommended pages per role;
    inferred persona badge appears on home page role picker after assessment completion

- **`src/services/crypto/OpenSSLService.ts`**: Primary cryptographic service wrapping OpenSSL WASM operations.
- **`src/store`**: Zustand state stores for theme, learning progress, assessment wizard, TLS simulation, and version tracking (all persisted to localStorage).
- **`src/data`**: Static data layer — TypeScript data files, versioned CSV files (timelines, leaders, library, software references), X.509 certificate profiles, and ACVP test vectors.
- **`src/utils`**: Utility functions for data conversion and common operations.

## Security

Last audited: February 28, 2026

| Severity | Production | Dev-only |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Critical | 0          | 0        |
| High     | 0          | 5        |
| Moderate | 0          | 1        |

All runtime/production dependencies have **zero known CVEs**. The 6 dev-only findings are confined to the ESLint linting toolchain (`minimatch` ReDoS) and do not affect the deployed application. Full resolution requires ESLint 9→10 major bump (tracked). See the [About page](/about) for full SBOM and CVE details.

To verify: `npm audit`
