_RFC 9882 ML-DSA in the CMS October 2025 Salter, et al. Standards Track [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9882 Category: Standards Track Published: October 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: B. Salter UK National Cyber Security Centre A. Raine UK National Cyber Security Centre D. Van Geest CryptoNext Security RFC 9882 Use of the ML-DSA Signature Algorithm in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Abstract The Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), as defined by NIST in FIPS 204, is a post-quantum digital signature scheme that aims to be secure against an adversary in possession of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). This document specifies the conventions for using the ML-DSA signature algorithm with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). In addition, the algorithm identifier syntax is provided. ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
