    overview:
      "The PQC Business Case module helps CISOs and executives build a compelling financial justification for post-quantum cryptography migration. It covers ROI calculation with weighted cost dimensions, breach scenario simulation comparing classical vs. quantum-enabled breach costs, and a structured board pitch builder that produces exportable executive presentations. All workshops integrate live data from the app's migration catalog, compliance frameworks, and assessment engine.",
    keyConcepts:
      'PQC Migration Cost Categories — four dimensions: migration costs (infrastructure layer upgrades), breach avoidance (quantum-enabled attack prevention), compliance penalties (regulatory fine avoidance), and operational/competitive advantages. ROI Calculation — weighted scorecard across 5 dimensions: migration cost by infrastructure (25%), breach avoidance savings (30%), compliance penalty avoidance (20%), operational efficiency (15%), competitive advantage (10%).',
    workshopSummary:
      'The workshop has 3 interactive steps: ROI Calculator — interactive scorecard with 5 weighted dimensions, auto-scored from migration catalog data; shows estimated migration cost, annual benefit, payback period, and 3-year ROI percentage. Breach Scenario Simulator — adjustable sliders for data records, regulatory fines, and HNDL years; compares classical vs. quantum breach costs with industry-specific baselines; generates key findings and cost-of-inaction analysis.',
