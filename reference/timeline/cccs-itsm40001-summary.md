## Procurement / Contract Clause Requirement

New IT procurements must include "clauses to ensure that the vendor will include support for PQC" — this is an ongoing obligation from roadmap adoption, **not tied to a specific hard deadline date**.

## Governance

IT Security Tripartite (TBS, SSC, Cyber Centre) provides oversight. Annual reporting via departmental service and digital plans.

## Notes for CSV validation

- Row 33 (Phase, Discovery 2025-2026): Correct — describes the planning period
- Row 34 originally titled "Contract PQC Clauses Required" with "April 1, 2026" deadline — **INCORRECT**. April 2026 is the migration plan deadline, not a contract clause deadline. Contract clauses are ongoing. Fixed in timeline_02192026.csv.
- Row 36 (2031 deadline): Confirmed ✅
- Row 38 (2035 deadline): Confirmed ✅
