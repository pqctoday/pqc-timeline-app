### What This Is About

TLS 1.3 secured the internet by enforcing modern forward secrecy and 1-RTT handshakes. Upgrading it for PQC involves integrating lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (ML-KEM) and signatures (ML-DSA).

### Why It Matters

Post-quantum algorithms demand much larger ciphertexts and keys than classical ECDH (like X25519). Notably, replacing classical certs with ML-DSA certificate chains adds several kilobytes to every handshake, threatening the scalability of billions of daily web connections.

### The Key Takeaway

The industry is already deploying "Hybrid" key exchange (X25519MLKEM768) to protect traffic from Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later attacks. To solve the signature bloat problem, engineers are developing Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs) to replace heavy certificate chains with lightweight proofs.

### What's Happening

Major browsers and CDN providers are already deploying hybrid key exchange (X25519MLKEM768) in production TLS 1.3, while the IETF is actively standardizing Merkle Tree Certificates to address the signature bloat challenge at internet scale.
