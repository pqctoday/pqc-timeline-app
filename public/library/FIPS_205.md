# Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard (SLH-DSA)

## Authors

**Organization:** NIST

## Scope

**Industries:** Firmware; Critical Infrastructure; Software Updates; Long-term Archival
**Region:** USA; Global
**Document type:** Algorithm

## How It Relates to PQC

CMS signatures, software signing, long-term archival signing

**Dependencies:** SPHINCS+; SP 800-208

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** Medium

Kevin M. Stine, Director Information Technology Laboratory FIPS 205 STATELESS HASH-BASED DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD Abstract This standard specifies the stateless hash-based digital signature algorithm (SLH-DSA). Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. SLH-DSA is based on SPHINCS+ , which was selected for standardization as part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process.

FIPS 205 STATELESS HASH-BASED DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 205 Published: August 13, 2024 Effective: August 13, 2024 Announcing the Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publications are developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under 15 U.S.C. 278g-3 and issued by the Secretary of Commerce under 40 U.S.C. 11331. 1. Name of Standard. Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard (FIPS 205). 2. Category of Standard. Computer Security. Subcategory. Cryptography. 3. Explanation. This standard specifies a stateless hash-based digital signature scheme (SLHDSA) for applications that require a digital signature rather than a written signature. Additional digital signature schemes are specified and approved in other NIST Special Publications and FIPS publications (e.g., FIPS 186-5 [1]). A digital signature is represented in a computer as a string of bits and computed using a set of rules and parameters that allow the identity of the signatory and the integrity of the data to be verified. Digital signatures may be generated on both stored and transmitted data. Signature generation uses a private key to generate a digital signature. Signature verification uses a public key that corresponds to but is not the same as the private key. Each signatory possesses a private and public key pair. Public keys may be known by the public, but private keys must be kept secret. Anyone can verify the signature by employing the signatory’s public key. Only the user who possesses the private key can perform signature generation. The digital signature is provided to the intended verifier along with the signed data. The verifying entity verifies the signature by using the claimed signatory’s public key. Similar procedures may be used to generate and verify signatures for both stored and transmitted data. This standard specifies several parameter sets for SLH-DSA that are approved for use. Additional parameter sets may be specified and approved in future NIST Special Publications. 4.
