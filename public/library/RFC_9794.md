_RFC 9794 PQ/T Hybrid Terminology June 2025 Driscoll, et al. Informational [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9794 Category: Informational Published: June 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: F. Driscoll UK National Cyber Security Centre M. Parsons UK National Cyber Security Centre B. Hale Naval Postgraduate School RFC 9794 Terminology for Post-Quantum Traditional Hybrid Schemes Abstract One aspect of the transition to post-quantum algorithms in cryptographic protocols is the development of hybrid schemes that incorporate both post-quantum and traditional asymmetric algorithms. This document defines terminology for such schemes. It is intended to be used as a reference and, hopefully, to ensure consistency and clarity across different protocols, standards, and organisations. ¶ Status of This Memo This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
