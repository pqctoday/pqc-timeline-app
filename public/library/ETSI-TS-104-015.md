# Efficient Quantum-Safe Hybrid Key Exchanges with Hidden Access Policies (Covercrypt)

## Authors

**Organization:** ETSI

## Scope

**Industries:** Data Protection; Cloud; Enterprise; Access Control
**Region:** Europe; International
**Document type:** Protocol

## How It Relates to PQC

Quantum-safe encryption with access control

**Dependencies:** NIST PQC; KEMAC

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Migration urgency:** Medium
