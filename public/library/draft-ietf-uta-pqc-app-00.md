# Post-Quantum Cryptography Recommendations for TLS-based Applications

## Authors

**Organization:** IETF UTA

## Scope

**Industries:** Web; Mobile; Cloud; DNS
**Region:** International
**Document type:** Guidance

## How It Relates to PQC

Application-level PQC guidance for TLS

**Dependencies:** draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design; FIPS 203

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Migration urgency:** High
