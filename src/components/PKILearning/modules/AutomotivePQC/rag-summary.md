# Automotive PQC — Module Summary

## Overview

Advanced-level module (120 min, 6 workshop steps) covering post-quantum cryptography migration for the automotive industry — an ecosystem with stringent functional safety requirements (ISO 26262), 15-year vehicle lifetimes that exceed the projected quantum threat window, complex in-vehicle network topologies, and a global OTA update infrastructure that is itself a primary attack surface.

## Key Topics

- **Vehicle electrical architecture evolution**: Domain-based architecture (separate ECUs per domain: powertrain, chassis, ADAS, body, infotainment, connectivity, each with domain controller) vs. zonal architecture (physical zones with high-performance central compute nodes — HPCs — aggregating control from multiple domains). ADAS zone is the most security-critical domain in both architectures; zonal HPCs introduce new PQC upgrade points at zone boundaries.
- **In-vehicle network buses**: CAN classic (500 Kbps, 8-byte payload — no native crypto, limited to HMAC/MAC with symmetric keys via AUTOSAR SecOC), CAN-FD (up to 8 Mbps, 64-byte payload — AUTOSAR SecOC with larger MAC capacity), LIN (slave bus, up to 20 Kbps — no crypto support), FlexRay (10 Mbps, dual-channel, deterministic real-time — safety-critical), Automotive Ethernet (100BASE-T1 to 10GBASE-T1, MACsec and TLS 1.3 support — primary PQC migration target for backbone links)
- **Functional safety levels**: ISO 26262 Automotive Safety Integrity Levels ASIL A (lowest) through ASIL D (highest) and QM (non-safety). Braking and steering ECUs are ASIL-D. PQC signature verification on ASIL-D components must not introduce timing jitter exceeding the ASIL-D deterministic timing budget — constant-time algorithm implementations mandatory. SLH-DSA and ML-DSA both have deterministic signing; verification timing must be characterized per target MCU.
- **Sensor data integrity for ADAS**: LiDAR (point cloud at 100 Hz, ML-DSA-44 for sensor-to-HPC signing — 2,420-byte signature at 100 Hz = 242 KB/s overhead), Camera (H.265 compressed stream, HMAC-SHA256 per GOP preferred over per-frame signing), Radar (CAN-FD bus, signed with AUTOSAR SecOC using AES-CMAC — symmetric only, no PQC signature feasible on CAN-FD today), Fusion output to ADAS decision module (ML-DSA-65 for critical path output attestation)
- **OTA software update architecture**: 3-layer signing chain — OEM root CA (ML-DSA-87, offline, HSM-protected), ECU group signing CA (ML-DSA-65, online, Tier-1-partitioned), delta/patch signing key (ML-DSA-44, per-campaign). UNECE WP.29 Regulation 156 mandates software update management system (SUMS) security requirements. 10–15 year vehicle lifetime extends well beyond the 2030–2035 CRQC projection window — vehicles sold today with RSA/ECDSA OTA signing are HNDL-exposed.
- **Digital car key protocols**: CCC Digital Key 3.0 (Car Connectivity Consortium — UWB ranging for precise positioning + NFC for tap-to-start + BLE for passive entry), ISO 18013-5 mobile driver's license (mDL) used as identity anchor for vehicle access, CPCQ (Classical/PQ Combined Key agreement, hybrid ML-KEM-768 + X25519) for phone-as-key key exchange. Offline operation required — PQC key verification must work without cellular connectivity.
- **Vehicle lifecycle and type approval**: UNECE R155 (cybersecurity management system — CSMS — mandatory for type approval in EU/Japan/Korea as of 2024), UNECE R156 (software update management), ISO/SAE 21434 (road vehicles cybersecurity engineering process standard), SOTIF ISO 21448 (safety of the intended functionality — intersects with ADAS crypto timing requirements). 15-year post-sale support obligation in EU (proposed) creates long PQC maintenance tail.
- **Algorithm sizing for automotive constraints**: ML-DSA-44 for ECU-to-ECU and OTA delta signing on capable MCUs; ML-KEM-768 for session key exchange on Automotive Ethernet backbone; HMAC-SHA256 + AES-CMAC retained for real-time CAN/CAN-FD buses where asymmetric crypto is not feasible; FN-DSA-512 for the most resource-constrained ECUs (e.g., BCM body control modules with Cortex-M4 at 64 MHz)

## Workshop Steps

1. **VehicleArchitectureMapper** — Compare domain-based vs. zonal architectures; identify crypto upgrade points at domain controllers, zone HPCs, and gateway ECUs; map PQC feasibility to each internal bus type
2. **SensorDataIntegritySimulator** — Configure signing strategies per sensor type (LiDAR, camera, radar, fusion); calculate bandwidth overhead at operating frequency; evaluate HMAC vs. ML-DSA tradeoffs for real-time data streams
3. **SafetyCryptoAnalyzer** — Map ASIL levels to crypto requirements; model worst-case ML-DSA verification latency on representative MCUs (Cortex-M7, RISC-V RH850, Aurix TC3xx); identify timing budget violations and mitigations
4. **OTAOrchestrationPlanner** — Design 3-layer OTA signing chain with ML-DSA-87/65/44; simulate UNECE R156 compliance verification; model campaign rollout for a mixed fleet of 2M vehicles across 6 model years
5. **CarKeyProtocolExplorer** — Step through CCC Digital Key 3.0 pairing and unlock flows with PQC key exchange; compare CPCQ hybrid vs. pure ML-KEM-768; test offline operation without network connectivity
6. **LifecycleMigrationRoadmap** — Build a phased migration plan covering type approval crypto (R155/R156), OTA signing chain cutover, Automotive Ethernet TLS upgrade, and car key re-issuance; model by vehicle generation and model year

## Key Data Points

- **ECU scope**: Premium vehicles contain 100–150 total ECUs; of these, 24–30 are security-relevant (the focus of PQC migration). Zone ECU counts in the workshop represent the security-relevant subset across 6 zones.
- **SAE autonomy levels**: Module uses SAE J3016 (2021). L2 (sedan), L3 conditional (SUV highway), L4 geofenced (shuttle, truck emerging). No L5 vehicles exist in production as of 2026. Higher autonomy increases quantum attack surface via more ECDSA sensor paths and mandatory V2X.
- CAN-FD maximum payload: 64 bytes — ML-DSA-44 signature (2,420 bytes) requires 38 CAN-FD frames; use AUTOSAR SecOC with AES-CMAC-128 (16 bytes) for real-time CAN buses
- Automotive Ethernet 100BASE-T1: 100 Mbps — ML-KEM-768 ciphertext (1,088 bytes) adds <0.1 ms overhead per session
- **Algorithm benchmarks** are for ARM Cortex-A72 @ 2 GHz. Real automotive ECUs (Cortex-R52 @ 400 MHz) expect 5–20× slower. FN-DSA-512 and LMS timings are estimated from reference implementations, not validated on production automotive silicon.
- ML-DSA-44 verification time: ~2–4 ms on Cortex-A72; ~5–15 ms on Cortex-R52 — may exceed 5 ms ADAS timing budget on constrained MCUs
- OTA update signing chain size: ML-DSA-87 (OEM root) + ML-DSA-65 (group CA) + ML-DSA-44 (delta) = cert chain ~14 KB over-the-air
- Vehicle HNDL exposure: 2026 model year vehicle (expected service to 2041) — RSA/ECDSA OTA signing keys encrypted today could be broken by CRQC within 10–20 year window
- V2X BSM: ~300-byte payload broadcast at 10 Hz per vehicle (~3 KB/s). PQC signature overhead (2,420 bytes ML-DSA-44) dwarfs the payload; constraint is signature + cert chain size, not payload budget.
- CCC Digital Key 3.0 UWB ranging precision: ±10 cm — PQC key exchange must complete within 500 ms for passive entry user experience
- UNECE R155 compliance: mandatory for new type approvals in 54 UNECE member states since July 2024; retroactive for existing types by July 2027
- **Regulatory confidence**: UNECE R155/R156, ISO/SAE 21434, CNSA 2.0 are published. IEEE 1609.2 PQC amendment is in development. China GB/T, Japan NISC, TISAX v7 PQC dates are projected (no official timelines published).
- ISO/SAE 21434 TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment): cryptographic asset inventory and risk classification required; ML-DSA/ML-KEM migration must be captured as cybersecurity goals
