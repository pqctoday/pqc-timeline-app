# Cryptographic Mechanisms: Recommendations for TLS

## Authors

**Organization:** BSI Germany

## Scope

**Industries:** Web; Cloud; Enterprise
**Region:** Germany; EU
**Document type:** Compliance/Guidance

## How It Relates to PQC

TLS configuration

**Dependencies:** TR-02102-1; RFC 8446; FIPS 203

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Migration urgency:** High
