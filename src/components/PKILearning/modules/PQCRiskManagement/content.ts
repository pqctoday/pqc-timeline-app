    overview:
      'The PQC Risk Management module teaches CISOs and security leaders how to identify, quantify, and prioritize quantum computing risks to their organization. It covers CRQC (Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer) scenario planning with adjustable timelines from 2028-2045, building comprehensive risk registers for quantum-vulnerable cryptographic assets, and generating likelihood-by-impact risk heatmaps.',
    keyConcepts:
      'CRQC Scenario Planning — model the cascading impact of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arriving in a given year; shows which algorithms break, which compliance deadlines are missed, and the HNDL (Harvest Now, Decrypt Later) exposure window. Risk Register Construction — systematic cataloging of cryptographic assets with fields for asset name, current algorithm, threat vector, likelihood (1-5), impact (1-5), and mitigation strategy; auto-calculates risk scores.',
    workshopSummary:
      'The workshop has 3 interactive steps: CRQC Scenario Planner — adjust a year slider (2028-2045) to model when a quantum computer could break current algorithms; see cascading impacts on 10 algorithms, 6 compliance deadlines, and HNDL exposure windows across 7 data retention periods. Risk Register Builder — create a multi-row risk register with pre-populated examples (TLS certificates, database encryption, code signing, VPN tunnels); export as Markdown and save to learning portfolio.',
