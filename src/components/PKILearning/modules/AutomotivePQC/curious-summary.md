# Automotive PQC — In Simple Terms

## What This Is About

Modern vehicles are essentially massive, high-speed computers on wheels. They have a 15+ year lifespan on the road. The digital cryptography and certificates embedded in the hardware today to secure firmware updates will face catastrophic quantum threats long before the vehicle retires.

## Why It Matters

An attacker equipped with a quantum computer could mathematically forge over-the-air (OTA) update signatures. This would allow them to bypass security checks and push highly malicious, weaponized firmware directly into the engine, brakes, and steering modules of thousands of vehicles simultaneously.

## The Key Takeaway

Automotive manufacturers must engineer their secure boot systems today to embed massive, quantum-safe root certificates (like LMS/HSS or ML-DSA) deeply into the vehicle's engine control units, long before the car ever rolls off the assembly line.

## What's Happening

Automotive standard bodies are racing to update the secure-by-design hardware specifications to handle the significantly larger file sizes of Post-Quantum signatures, ensuring that the heavy math can run smoothly on resource-constrained microcontrollers.
