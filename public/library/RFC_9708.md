_RFC 9708 Use of the HSS/LMS Hash-Based Signature January 2025 Housley Standards Track [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9708 Obsoletes: 8708 Category: Standards Track Published: January 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Author: R. Housley Vigil Security RFC 9708 Use of the HSS/LMS Hash-Based Signature Algorithm in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Abstract This document specifies the conventions for using the Hierarchical Signature System (HSS) / Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) hash-based signature algorithm with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). In addition, the algorithm identifier and public key syntax are provided. The HSS/LMS algorithm is one form of hash-based digital signature; it is described in RFC 8554. This document obsoletes RFC 8708. ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
