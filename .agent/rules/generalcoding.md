when asked to find a bug and fix it

Start by listing 3 likely root causes ranked.
Pick one and propose the smallest possible diff.
After each change: explain expected effect + what log/test proves it.
No refactors unless a test proves they’re required.
If 2 attempts fail, stop and ask me for the missing info you need.
