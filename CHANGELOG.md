## [2.11.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **IT Ops / DevOps persona** (`learningPersonas.ts`, `personaConfig.ts`): 5th persona role
  targeting infrastructure operators. Tailored learning path (11 modules, 705 min), assessment
  wizard hints for all 14 steps, landing page CTAs ("Explore Migration Catalog", "Try OpenSSL
  Studio"), persona-aware navigation (Migrate, OpenSSL, Library, Playground), and inference
  from assessment results. Integrated across GeminiService, PersonalizedAvatar, PersonaPicker,
  seedHistory, and personaWizardHints. [persona:ops]

- **Multi-view Migrate catalog** (`MigrateView.tsx`, `MigrateViewToggle.tsx`,
  `MigrateSortControl.tsx`, `SoftwareCard.tsx`, `SoftwareCardGrid.tsx`, `migrateHelpers.tsx`):
  Three view modes — Stack (existing infrastructure layers), Cards (responsive grid), and Table
  (sortable columns) — with a persistent view toggle. Four sort options (Name, PQC Support,
  Migration Priority, FIPS Status) and flat-mode filters (layer dropdown, category dropdown,
  search bar). Store upgraded v3→v4 with `viewMode` persistence. [view:/migrate]

- **Multi-view Learn dashboard** (`Dashboard.tsx`, `LearnViewToggle.tsx`, `LearnTrackStack.tsx`,
  `ModuleTable.tsx`): Three view modes — Stack (track-grouped accordion), Cards (existing
  ModuleCard grid), and Table (sortable columns with expand). Six sort modes (Default, Name,
  Difficulty, Duration, Recently visited, Status) with persona, track, difficulty, status, and
  search filters. Six learning tracks (Foundations, Strategy, Protocols, Infrastructure,
  Applications, Executive). ModuleCard enhanced with progress bars and step tracking. [view:/learn]

- **Unified progress backup/restore** (`LandingView.tsx`, `UnifiedStorageService.ts`,
  `snapshotTypes.ts`): Export and import buttons on the landing page. Full-app snapshot covers
  learning progress, assessment state, persona, theme, OpenSSL files, TLS configs, migrate
  selections, and chat history. API keys excluded from export for security. [view:/]

- **Pure TypeScript X.509 DER cert builder** (`certBuilder.ts`): Standalone certificate builder
  with ASN.1 DER encoding primitives, DN parsing, v3 extensions, and PEM armoring. Supports
  arbitrary signer functions (e.g., liboqs SLH-DSA) for algorithms not yet in OpenSSL WASM.
  Used by HybridCASetup and HybridCertFormats workshops. [view:/learn]

- **5 new glossary terms** (`glossaryData.ts`): Composite Certificate, Related Certificate
  (RFC 9763), Chameleon Certificate, TBSCertificate, AlgorithmIdentifier — supporting the
  expanded Hybrid Crypto module. [view:/learn]

  Competition results (HAETAE, AIMer, SMAUG-T, NTRU+), FIPS 140-3 IG self-test guidance for
  FIPS 203/204/205, 3GPP PQC study, liboqs v0.15.0, TPM 2.0 hybrid PQC, and FIPS 206 (FN-DSA).

- **RAG corpus** (`rag-corpus.json`): Regenerated with all data and module changes (~2,200
  knowledge chunks).

## [2.10.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **KMS-PQC module** (`kms-pqc`): New 5-step intermediate module (90 min) — PQC Key Management
  Systems. Covers envelope encryption with ML-KEM-768, hybrid key wrapping, multi-provider key
  hierarchy design, KMS rotation planner, and a KMIP Protocol Explorer (Operations, Key Types,
  Cross-Provider Sync, Readiness Checklist). Split from the legacy key-management module.
  [view:/learn] [persona:architect] [persona:developer]

- **HSM-PQC module** (`hsm-pqc`): New 4-step advanced module (90 min) — Hardware Security
  Modules for PQC. Features a PKCS#11 v3.2 simulator, vendor comparison matrix, HSM migration
  planner, and FIPS 140-3 validation tracker. Split from the legacy key-management module.
  [view:/learn] [persona:architect] [persona:developer]

- **Data Asset Sensitivity module** (`data-asset-sensitivity`): New 5-step intermediate module
  (75 min) — classify organizational data assets, map compliance obligations (GDPR, HIPAA, DORA,
  NIS2), apply NIST RMF / ISO 27005 / FAIR risk methodologies, and generate a PQC migration
  priority map. [view:/learn] [persona:executive] [persona:architect]

- **Hybrid Crypto — Hybrid CA Setup** (`HybridCASetup.tsx`, Step 3): Interactive workshop to
  configure and generate classical (ECDSA) and PQC (ML-DSA-65) root CAs. Demonstrates the
  dual-key hierarchy required for transitional hybrid PKI deployments. [view:/learn]
  [persona:developer] [persona:architect]

- **Hybrid Crypto — Hybrid Cert Formats** (`HybridCertFormats.tsx`, Step 4): Side-by-side
  generator and comparison of all four X.509 hybrid certificate approaches — Pure PQC (ML-DSA-65,
  SLH-DSA-128s), Composite (draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs-14, OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.6.45),
  Related Certificates (RFC 9763), and Chameleon Certificates. Each entry shows OID, IETF status,
  backward-compatibility notes, and ASN.1 structure. [view:/learn]

- **Hybrid Crypto — Hybrid Cert Inspector** (`HybridCertInspector.tsx`, Step 5): Deep-dive
  certificate structure viewer with Tree, Raw, and Size views. Ships with four IETF Hackathon
  reference certificates (r5 release): Composite ML-DSA65-ECDSA-P256-SHA512, Catalyst
  ECDSA-P256 + ML-DSA-44, Pure ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204 reference), and Chameleon ECDSA-P256 +
  ML-DSA-44. [view:/learn]

- **Merkle Tree Certs — Signatureless Certificates section** (`MTCIntroduction.tsx`): New
  collapsible "Advanced: Signatureless Certificates & Landmarks" section explaining landmark
  subtrees, pre-sync windows, and signatureless TLS handshakes. Includes ML-DSA-44 size analysis
  table (0 B signature + 736 B inclusion proof vs 2480 B per-connection ML-DSA-44 signature —
  ~94% handshake reduction). [view:/learn]

### Changed

- **Hybrid Crypto module** (`HybridCrypto/`): Expanded from 3 to 5 steps. Steps 3–5 replace
  the old `CompositeCertificateViewer` with the new HybridCASetup → HybridCertFormats →
  HybridCertInspector workshop sequence. RAG summary updated with RFC 9763, Catalyst binding
  draft, Chameleon certs draft, and IETF Hackathon pqc-certificates repository. [view:/learn]

- **Key Management split** (`useModuleStore` v5→v6): The `key-management` module has been split
  into `kms-pqc` (Key Management Systems, 5 steps) and `hsm-pqc` (Hardware Security Modules,
  4 steps). Store migration automatically copies legacy progress into both new modules and removes
  the old key. [view:/learn]

- **Merkle Tree Certs workshops** (`MerkleTreeBuilder.tsx`, `InclusionProofGenerator.tsx`,
  `ProofVerifier.tsx`, `SizeComparison.tsx`): Refactored with advanced metrics and clearer size
  analysis. Proof size reference updated from ~100 B to ~96 B (ML-DSA-44 benchmark). [view:/learn]

  algorithm selection and inline validation for the sign/verify workflow. [view:/playground]

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Entropy workshop — Bit Matrix Grid** (`BitMatrixGrid.tsx`): New shared visualization component
  renders byte data as a pixel grid where each bit maps to a colored cell. Random data appears as TV
  static; patterns show visible structure. Supports bit-level and byte-level view modes, interactive
  click-to-toggle for the Bit Flipper, and flipped-bit highlighting. Used across Steps 1, 2, and 4.
  [view:/learn]

- **Entropy workshop — Lag Plot** (`LagPlot.tsx`): SVG autocorrelation scatter plot of
  `(byte[i], byte[i+k])` pairs. Random data fills the square uniformly; incrementing data produces
  a diagonal line; repeating patterns create dot clusters. Configurable lag selector (k=1,2,4,8)
  reveals sequential correlations invisible to histograms. [view:/learn]

- **Entropy workshop — Bad RNG comparison** (`RandomGenerationDemo.tsx`): Step 1 now supports 4
  sources: Web Crypto, OpenSSL WASM, `Math.random()`, and a timestamp-seeded LCG. Side-by-side
  display with BitMatrixGrid, histogram, and lag plot for each source. LCG prediction demo proves
  determinism by correctly predicting future output bytes. Cross-source test comparison table.
  [view:/learn]

- **Entropy workshop — Bit Flipper** (`BitFlipExperiment.tsx`): New interactive mode in Step 2.
  Start with random data, click individual bits to toggle them, watch all 5 test results update in
  real time. Quick actions (Flip 5%/10%/25%, All Zeros, Reset). Corruption counter with progress
  bar. Teaches which tests break first under different degradation patterns. [view:/learn]

- **Entropy workshop — Streaming Monitor** (`StreamingEntropyMonitor.tsx`, `EntropyGauge.tsx`):
  Live dashboard mode in Step 2 with continuous byte generation and 5 animated radial gauge arcs
  with sparkline history. Switch sources mid-stream to watch gauges swing from green to red.
  Configurable speed (200ms–2s) and source selection. [view:/learn]

- **Entropy workshop — DRBG Simulator** (`DRBGSimulator.tsx`): Interactive CTR_DRBG state machine
  added as collapsible panel in Step 3 (ESV Walkthrough). Step through Instantiate → Generate →
  Reseed lifecycle with visible internal state (V, Key, counter), pipeline flow visualization, and
  forced reseed interval. Connects ESV validation to practical DRBG usage. [view:/learn]

- **Entropy workshop — 4 new exercises** (`EntropyExercises.tsx`): Visual Pattern Recognition, Bad
  RNG Challenge, Bit Corruption Threshold, and Live Degradation exercises (6–9) guide users through
  the new interactive features. [view:/learn]

### Changed

- **Entropy workshop — Step 2 modes** (`EntropyTestingDemo.tsx`): Testing step now has three modes
  via tab selector: Static Tests (original flow enhanced with BitMatrixGrid + LagPlot), Bit Flipper,
  and Live Monitor. [view:/learn]

- **Entropy workshop — Step 4 visualizations** (`QRNGDemo.tsx`): QRNG vs TRNG comparison now
  includes side-by-side BitMatrixGrid and LagPlot visualizations alongside existing histograms.
  [view:/learn]

## [2.8.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **PQC Risk Management — heatmap UX** (`RiskHeatmapGenerator.tsx`): Three discoverability fixes
  in the Step 3 Risk Heatmap workshop. (1) Click hint replaced from invisible muted text to a
  prominent bordered pill with `MousePointer2` icon so users know cells are interactive.
  (2) Inherent/Residual Risk toggle is now always visible on load instead of being hidden until
  the first treatment is assigned — Residual button is disabled with a tooltip until at least one
  treatment exists. (3) Heatmap automatically switches to Residual view when the first treatment
  strategy is assigned, making the risk reduction immediately visible. [view:/learn]

## [2.8.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **ML-KEM decapsulate** (`KemConfig.tsx`, `Workbench.tsx`): Resolved "Public Key operation error"
  caused by unclear file selection after encapsulation. Key file dropdown now filters to `.pub`
  files for encap and `.key` files for decap. Ciphertext input dropdown excludes key files.
  Encapsulate now shows separate "Ciphertext Output" and "Shared Secret Output" fields so filenames
  are explicit and cannot collide. [view:/openssl]

### Changed

- **OpenSSL Studio — KEM config** (`KemConfig.tsx`, `openssl.worker.ts`): Added configurable
  `-secret` output filename (was hardcoded to `secret.bin`). Post-encap terminal hint now shows
  which file is the ciphertext and which is the shared secret, with a reminder to use the ciphertext
  as input to decapsulate. [view:/openssl]

- **OpenSSL Studio — educational flow hints** (`DgstConfig.tsx`, `EncConfig.tsx`, `LmsConfig.tsx`,
  `Pkcs12Config.tsx`): Consistent context-aware hint box added below the action toggle in every
  dual-mode operation panel. Each hint explains the inputs, outputs, and key type required for
  the selected mode:
  - **Sign/Verify**: private key + data → signature; public key + data + signature → valid/invalid
  - **Encrypt/Decrypt**: plaintext + passphrase (PBKDF2) → ciphertext; reverse to recover plaintext
  - **LMS Generate/Sign/Verify**: stateful keypair creation; private key mutates on each signature
  - **PKCS#12 Export/Import**: bundle cert + key into password-protected .p12; extract with same password
    [view:/openssl]

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **My Products tracking** (`MigrateView.tsx`, `SoftwareTable.tsx`, `useMigrateSelectionStore.ts`):
  Checkbox column in the Migrate catalog lets users mark products as "My Products" for cross-module
  analysis. Infrastructure stack badges show selected count per layer. Store upgraded v2 to v3 with
  `myProducts` array, `toggleMyProduct`, and `clearMyProducts` actions.
  [persona:architect] [persona:executive] [view:/migrate]

- **Compliance Gantt chart** (`ComplianceGantt.tsx`): New Gantt-style timeline for the Compliance
  Strategy module. Renders compliance deadlines grouped by jurisdiction with interactive phase bars,
  status indicators (completed/on-track/at-risk), and user-defined milestone markers with
  category-based colour coding.
  [persona:executive] [persona:architect] [view:/learn]

- **Infrastructure Selector** (`InfrastructureSelector.tsx`): New Step 1 in the Vendor Risk module
  workshop — select infrastructure products from the Migrate catalog with FIPS and PQC support
  badges. Selected products feed into the Vendor Scorecard, Contract Clauses, and Supply Chain
  Matrix. [persona:architect] [view:/learn]

- **`risk-treatment-plan` document type** (`types.ts`): New executive document type for persisting
  risk treatment artifacts from the Risk Heatmap Generator. [persona:developer]

### Changed

- **Risk Heatmap Generator** (`RiskHeatmapGenerator.tsx`): Complete rewrite with 5x5
  likelihood-vs-impact matrix, four risk treatment strategies (mitigate, accept, transfer, avoid)
  with contextual guidance, residual risk overrides per entry, and before/after heatmap comparison.
  Exports to markdown via ExportableArtifact.
  [persona:executive] [persona:architect] [view:/learn]

- **ROI Calculator** (`ROICalculator.tsx`): Shifted from 5-dimension scorecard to direct financial
  modelling with editable inputs (products to migrate, cost per product, breach probability,
  applicable frameworks, penalty per incident, planning horizon). Auto-seeds from assessment data
  and Migrate catalog via `useExecutiveModuleData`. Outputs total migration cost, avoided breach
  cost, compliance savings, net ROI, and payback period.
  [persona:executive] [persona:architect] [view:/learn]

- **Breach Cost Model** (`BreachCostModel.tsx`): Quantum threat assumptions (quantum multiplier,
  HNDL exposure factor, regulatory multiplier) are now user-configurable via sliders instead of
  hardcoded values, enabling scenario modelling.
  [persona:executive] [view:/learn]

- **Vendor Scorecard Builder** (`VendorScorecardBuilder.tsx`): Redesigned to score products from
  the Migrate catalog. Six weighted dimensions (PQC algorithm support, FIPS validation, PQC
  roadmap, crypto agility, SBOM/CBOM, hybrid mode) with auto-detection of PQC support and FIPS
  status from product data. [persona:architect] [view:/learn]

- **Compliance Timeline Builder** (`ComplianceTimelineBuilder.tsx`): Integrated ComplianceGantt
  visualization, auto-grouping framework deadlines by jurisdiction, gap analysis with at-risk /
  on-track / completed status indicators, and detail popovers for individual phases.
  [persona:executive] [persona:architect] [view:/learn]

- **Jurisdiction Mapper** (`JurisdictionMapper.tsx`): Enhanced with product preview cards showing
  selected Migrate catalog products, conflict detection between overlapping jurisdiction
  requirements, and deep links to the Migrate view.
  [persona:architect] [view:/learn]

- **Vendor Risk module** (`VendorRisk/index.tsx`): Restructured workshop from 3 steps to 4 — new
  Step 1 (Your Infrastructure) precedes Vendor Scorecard (Step 2), Contract Clauses (Step 3), and
  Supply Chain Matrix (Step 4). [persona:architect] [view:/learn]

- **`useExecutiveModuleData`** (`useExecutiveModuleData.ts`): Accepts optional `selectedProductKeys`
  parameter to filter metrics to user-selected products, with smart layer splitting for products
  spanning multiple infrastructure layers. [persona:developer]

- **Executive artifacts** (`ArtifactBuilder.tsx`, `ExportableArtifact.tsx`, `TimelinePlanner.tsx`):
  Refined layout, styling, and export formatting across shared executive workshop components.
  [persona:developer]

### Data

- **Compliance CSV rotation**: Deleted 3 stale snapshots (`compliance_02222026.csv`,
  `compliance_02242026.csv`, `compliance_02262026.csv`), added fresh `compliance_03012026.csv`.

- **RAG corpus**: Regenerated `public/data/rag-corpus.json` to reflect all data and module changes.

### Fixed

- **CBOM Scanner** (`CBOMScanner.tsx`): Minor layout and styling fixes in the Crypto Agility
  workshop. [persona:developer] [view:/learn]

- **MTC module** (`MTCIntroduction.tsx`, `MTCExercises.tsx`, `mtcConstants.ts`,
  `SizeComparison.tsx`): Minor content corrections and data constant updates.
  [persona:developer] [view:/learn]

- **KPI Tracker Template** (`KPITrackerTemplate.tsx`): Layout refinements in the Migration Program
  module. [persona:developer] [view:/learn]

- **Roadmap Builder** (`RoadmapBuilder.tsx`): Styling adjustments in the Migration Program module.
  [persona:developer] [view:/learn]

- **OpenSSL Worker** (`openssl.worker.ts`): Minor worker-side adjustment.
  [persona:developer] [view:/openssl]

- **Chat panel** (`ChatPanelContent.tsx`): Additional overflow guard.
  [persona:developer]

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Executive Board Brief** (`BoardBriefSection.tsx`): New printable 2-page C-suite summary
  triggered from the report toolbar. Page 1 covers risk gauge, category breakdown (2×2 grid),
  top-3 priority actions, and Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later alerts. Page 2 presents the financial
  case with ROI table, mandated compliance frameworks, and key findings.
  [persona:executive] [view:/assess]

- **ROI Calculator** (`ROICalculatorSection.tsx`, `roiBaselines.ts`): New collapsible report
  section for modelling the PQC migration financial case. Four adjustable parameters (migration
  budget, breach probability, compliance penalty, planning horizon) are auto-seeded from
  assessment inputs. Outputs include avoided breach cost, compliance savings, net ROI (%), and
  payback period, plus a bar-chart breakdown. Industry baselines sourced from IBM Cost of a Data
  Breach Report 2024 (11 sectors). ROI summary exports to the Board Brief.
  [persona:executive] [persona:architect] [view:/assess]

- **Risk Score Trending** (`KPITrendingSection.tsx`): New report section showing historical
  risk score progression (line chart) and a radar chart comparing current vs. previous category
  scores across Quantum Exposure, Migration Complexity, Regulatory Pressure, and Org Readiness.
  Activates when 2+ assessment snapshots are present. [persona:executive] [persona:architect] [view:/assess]

- **Assessment history persistence** (`useAssessmentStore.ts`): New `assessmentHistory`
  array and `pushSnapshot()` action persisted to localStorage. Each `AssessmentSnapshot` records
  timestamp, risk score, risk level, category scores, and industry — enabling the trending section
  and future comparison views. [persona:developer]

- **Assessment URL sharing** (`ReportView.tsx`): Share button now encodes full assessment
  state into URL parameters (industry, country, algorithms, data sensitivity, frameworks,
  migration status, use cases, retention, scale, agility, infrastructure, vendors, timeline
  pressure). Opening the URL auto-hydrates the store for instant report replay.
  [persona:executive] [persona:architect] [view:/assess]

- **`recharts` dependency**: Added Recharts v3.7.0 for the ROI bar chart and KPI trending
  line/radar charts. [persona:developer]

- **Community section on About page** (`AboutView.tsx`): New GitHub Discussions panel listing
  11 topic-specific channels — Contribute, PQC News, Ideas, Q&A, Algorithms, Learn Modules,
  Leaders, References, Timeline, Threats, Products. Each card links directly to its discussion
  thread with an icon and description. [persona:researcher] [persona:developer] [view:/about]

- **GitHub: FUNDING.yml**: Added GitHub Sponsors funding configuration.

- **GitHub: data_suggestion.yml**: New issue template for users to suggest data updates,
  corrections, or new entries across the library, migrate catalog, compliance, or timeline.

### Changed

- **Report section visibility** (`ReportContent.tsx`): Sections now support `'open'`,
  `'closed'`, or `'hidden'` visibility states per persona. A summary/full-report toggle appears
  when sections are hidden for a persona. Affected sections: risk score, key findings, assessment
  profile, HNDL/HNFL, algorithm migration, compliance impact, recommended actions, migration
  roadmap, toolkit, ROI calculator, KPI trending, threat landscape, country timeline, risk
  breakdown, executive summary. [persona:developer]

## [2.6.2] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Timeline document cards view**: `DocumentTable` redesigned with a cards/table view toggle
  (`ViewToggle`). Card grid shows phase badge, org, period, description preview, enrichment
  sparkle indicator, source link, and a "View Details" action. [persona:researcher] [persona:developer] [view:/timeline]

- **`TimelineDocumentCard`**: New animated card component (Framer Motion `popLayout`) rendering
  one timeline document row with enrichment awareness — shows a `Sparkles` badge when AI
  enrichment is available. [persona:developer] [view:/timeline]

- **`TimelineDocumentDetailPopover`**: New accessible portal popover (FocusLock + `createPortal`)
  for timeline document detail. Shows full metadata, enrichment analysis panel
  (`DocumentAnalysis` reuse), phase-coloured header, and an `AskAssistantButton` pre-seeded with
  document context. [persona:developer] [view:/timeline]

- **`timelineEnrichmentData.ts`**: New data module that discovers and loads
  `doc-enrichments/timeline_doc_enrichments_*.md` via `import.meta.glob`, picks the latest by
  embedded date, parses enrichment sections, and exports `getTimelineEnrichmentKey()` and
  `hasSubstantiveEnrichment()` helpers. [persona:developer]

- **Table view: sortable columns** — clicking any column header in table mode cycles `asc`/`desc`
  with chevron indicators. Default sort: Period ascending. [persona:researcher] [persona:executive] [view:/timeline]

- **Org name from event data**: `DocumentTable` now reads `phase.events[0]?.orgName` as the
  primary org label, falling back to country bodies, improving specificity for multi-body
  countries. [persona:researcher] [view:/timeline]

- **New npm scripts**: `enrich:timeline` / `enrich:timeline:dry` (Haiku enrichment pipeline for
  timeline documents) and `notebooklm` (`tsx scripts/generate-notebooklm.ts` for NotebookLM
  package generation). `notebooklm/` output directory added to `.gitignore`. [persona:developer]

- **Glossary — 8 new terms**: DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm with NIST IR 8547 deprecation
  context), PQXDH (Signal's post-quantum key agreement, Signal Sep 2023 deployment), RFC 8446
  (TLS 1.3 standard with PQC extension context), NIS2 Directive (EU 2022/2555, ENISA PQC link),
  NIST SP 800-131A (algorithm transition guidance), Certificate Transparency (RFC 9162 + MTC
  connection), HPKE (RFC 9180, TLS ECH / MLS / PQC drafts), and a dedicated PQXDH entry
  separated from the Signal Protocol term. [persona:researcher] [persona:developer] [view:/learn]

### Changed

- **Glossary corrections**: FIPS 206 and FN-DSA definitions updated from "draft / expected
  2025–2026" to "published October 2024". Removed incorrect `acronym` fields from Shor's
  Algorithm, Grover's Algorithm, BIP-360, and Signal Protocol. Sigstore, SLSA, and in-toto
  categories corrected (`concept` → `organization` / `standard`). Added `relatedModule` links to
  FrodoKEM, SHAKE, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Ascon, FHE, and ZKP entries. [persona:researcher] [view:/learn]

- **`libraryEnrichmentData.parseTimeline()`**: Now merges extracted keywords alongside year
  entries when processing the Haiku extraction format, ensuring keyword-tagged milestones appear
  in the Migration Timeline dimension. [persona:developer]

### Fixed

- **Chat panel — horizontal overflow**: `ChatPanelContent` message list gains `overflow-x-hidden`;
  `ChatMessage` bubble gains `min-w-0`. Markdown `<pre>` blocks wrap in a scrollable
  `overflow-x-auto` div; Markdown `<table>` elements wrap in a scrollable container, preventing
  wide AI responses from expanding the panel beyond the viewport. [persona:developer] [persona:researcher] [persona:architect]

## [2.6.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Timeline ↔ Library coverage audit**: Audited all 116 unique `SourceUrl` values in
  `timeline_02282026.csv` against the library's `download_url` column. Coverage rose from 23
  matches (20%) to 55 (47%) after adding 32 new entries.

- **32 new library entries** (`library_03012026.csv` — 231 total) covering Tier 1 official
  government and standards-body documents identified as timeline source gaps:
  ANSSI PQC position paper and FAQ, EC Recommendation 2024/1101, G7 CEG Financial PQC Roadmap,
  Canada TBS SPIN notice and CFDIR best practices, ENISA PQC Integration Study, Europol QSFF
  call to action, UK NCSC white paper and migration timelines, UK DSIT CNI perspectives, UK CMORG
  financial guidance, NATO Quantum Technologies Strategy, NSA CNSA 2.0 canonical page, US QCCPA
  2022, US CISA Automated PQC Discovery strategy and OT considerations, EU-BSI 21-nation joint
  statement, BSI-ANSSI-NLNCSA QKD position paper, SG MAS quantum advisory and QKD sandbox report,
  SG Quantum-Safe Handbook, AU ASD ISM Guidelines for Cryptography, GSMA PQ.03 v2.0 and
  country-by-country survey, CZ NUKIB minimum crypto requirements, IL INCD Cybersecurity Strategy,
  IN CERT-In QBOM guidelines and TEC PQC migration report. PQCC Migration Roadmap and Inventory
  Workbook URLs updated to specific pages.

- **`library_doc_enrichments_03012026.md`**: 195 enriched documents (was 163) — 32 new sections
  added via Haiku extraction agents covering all newly added library entries. Document Enrichments
  RAG source grows to 370 chunks.

### Fixed

- **Library enrichment — Migration Timeline parser**: `parseTimeline()` now handles the Haiku
  extraction format (`"year: description; year: description"`, semicolon-separated, no prefix)
  alongside the legacy `Milestones: A | B | C` pipe-separated format. Also correctly suppresses
  `"None detected (...)"` variants. Migration Timeline dimension now visible in Library detail
  views for all 32 new documents.

- **PQC Assistant — leaders retrieval**: Added `leaders: 1.5` boost to the `general` intent in
  `INTENT_BOOSTS` so leader chunks are not outranked by document enrichments for leader-focused
  queries (e.g. "PQC leaders and researchers").

- **LeadersGrid tests**: Country filter tests updated to use `filter-Country` testId — the
  component's Region and Country dropdowns are separate since the Region/Country filter split in
  v2.5.x.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **PQC Assistant integration — detail views**: `AskAssistantButton` added to all seven detail
  panels: AlgorithmComparison, ComplianceDetailPopover, LeaderCard, LibraryDetailPopover,
  SoftwareTable, ThreatDetailDialog, and GanttDetailPopover. Each button carries context-aware
  prompt templates (e.g., classical↔PQC migration rationale, threat mitigations by industry,
  timeline phase significance).

- **AlgorithmComparison interactive table**: 3-way column sorting (asc → desc → none) on all
  four columns; drag-to-resize column separators; "Find tools" deep-links from PQC algorithm
  cells to `/migrate?q=<algo>`; separate `MobileAlgorithmList` for `lg:hidden` with accessible
  `aria-sort` attributes and `<caption>` on the desktop table.

- **SoftwareTable — PQC certifications in expanded rows**: Per-product certifications badge
  panel (FIPS 140-3 green, ACVP blue, Common Criteria amber) pulled from
  `migrate_certification_xref_02282026.csv`. Three-tier FIPS badge (`Validated` / `Partial` / `No`)
  with icon indicators replaces prior boolean display.

- **ThreatDetailDialog — related modules**: Pill-style links to `/learn/<slug>` with BookOpen
  icon when `threat.relatedModules` is populated; AI button asks about PQC mitigations by
  industry and criticality.

- **GuidedTour — comprehensive test suite**: Full lifecycle coverage — localStorage persistence,
  intro slides, knowledge-gate branching (learning/basics/expert paths), feature nav, and
  dismissal. `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `AnimatePresence` sync mock used throughout.

- **Chat system — extensive test coverage**: `useChatSend.test.ts` covers happy-path streaming,
  guards (empty query, null API key, active loading), error handling (generic, invalid key,
  AbortError, 60s timeout), and 1000-char input length cap. `GeminiService.systemPrompt.test.ts`
  covers identity, knowledge boundary, page context, persona depth (executive/developer/architect/
  researcher), and assessment context injection.

- **New data: algorithms_transitions CSVs** — three snapshots (`02222026`, `02272026`,
  `02282026`) added to `src/data/` providing algorithm transition timeline data.

### Changed

- **Data maintenance — CSV date correction**: Removed date-shifted future files
  (`library_03212026.csv`, `library_03222026.csv`, `pqcquiz_03232026.csv`,
  `pqcquiz_03242026.csv`, `quantum_safe_cryptographic_software_reference_03182026.csv`,
  `quantum_safe_cryptographic_software_reference_03262026.csv`, `timeline_03012026.csv`).
  Correct Feb 2026–dated snapshots now active; `shift-csv-dates.py` script added for future
  maintenance.

- **LeaderCard accessibility**: `AskAssistantButton` at bottom-right; `StatusBadge` in
  top-right corner; `min-h-[44px]` touch targets on external links (WCAG AA); LinkedIn button
  uses `.bg-status-info` semantic token.

- **RAG corpus**: Regenerated (`public/data/rag-corpus.json`) to incorporate enriched document
  metadata from new datasets.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Library Document Analysis panel**: Collapsible `<DocumentAnalysis>` component in Library view
  shows AI-extracted enrichment metadata per document — main topic, PQC algorithms, quantum
  threats, migration timelines, regions, protocols, infrastructure layers, standardization bodies,
  and compliance frameworks. Powered by `src/data/libraryEnrichmentData.ts` parser.

- **Maintenance guide**: `docs/maintenance-guide.md` — comprehensive reference for all page data
  sources, update procedures, cross-page connections, RAG pipeline, and Zustand store inventory.

### Changed

- **Timeline data**: Fresh `timeline_02282026.csv` snapshot (Feb 28, 2026) covering EU QARC
  project launch, IBM Heron R2 quantum chip, Microsoft Majorana 1 topological qubit announcement,
  and updated QSP roadmap milestones.

- **RAG corpus**: Regenerated with full enrichment metadata from 220+ enriched documents;
  cross-references between threats↔compliance, leaders↔algorithms, and library↔algorithms
  now included in all chunk metadata.

- **Open-source compliance**: SPDX `GPL-3.0-only` license identifiers added to all 500+ source
  files; `package.json` `license` field normalized to SPDX-compliant value.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Personalization wizard**: 4-step onboarding (Experience → Role → Region → Industry) with
  animated stepper, info modals explaining how each choice shapes the experience,
  `PersonalizedAvatar` live preview, and embedded `ScoreCard`. Replaces the previous 3-row
  inline form.

- **Experience level personalization**: New `ExperienceLevel` type (`new` / `basics` / `expert`)
  in `usePersonaStore` v2. Wired through guided tour knowledge gate, personalization wizard,
  and learning experience difficulty filtering.

- **Guided tour rewrite**: 3-phase centered card design replacing nav-anchored tooltips.
  Phase 1 — Intro (3 slides explaining why PQC matters). Phase 2 — Knowledge Gate
  ("How familiar are you?") adjusts tour length: "Just learning" → full 13-feature tour,
  "Know the basics" → essential-only 5 slides, "Expert" → dismisses tour. Phase 3 — Feature
  cards (up to 13, persona-filtered) with swipeable drag interaction and dot indicators.

- **PQC Explainer**: Dismissible "Why does this matter?" component on the landing page with
  3 educational cards (modern encryption → quantum threat → new standards). Persistent
  dismissal via localStorage; CTA links to PQC 101 module.

- **Page accuracy feedback**: Fixed bottom-left thumbs-up/down widget on 8 content routes
  (`/learn`, `/timeline`, `/leaders`, `/algorithms`, `/library`, `/compliance`, `/threats`,
  `/migrate`). Logs votes via GA4 `logAccuracyFeedback()`; resets on page navigation.

- **Document enrichment pipeline**: `scripts/enrich-public-docs.py` extracts 11 structured
  dimensions (algorithms, threats, protocols, infrastructure layers, compliance frameworks,
  standardization bodies, etc.) from 220+ archived HTML/PDF documents. Outputs date-stamped
  markdown to `src/data/doc-enrichments/`, consumed by the RAG corpus generator.

- **RAG cross-references**: Post-processing pass in `generate-rag-corpus.ts` adds cross-domain
  links between threats↔compliance, leaders↔algorithms, library↔algorithms, and
  compliance↔timeline. Capped at 3 cross-refs per chunk.

- **Entity inventory**: `extractEntityInventory()` in GeminiService builds a compact entity list
  from retrieved RAG chunks (max 30), injected into the system prompt as a hallucination guard —
  the model is instructed to say "not in the current database" for items not in the inventory.

- **OpenSSL Studio deep linking**: `?cmd=` query parameter with user-friendly aliases
  (`keygen` → `genpkey`, `cert` → `x509`, `sign` → `dgst`, `enc` → `enc`, `hash` → `dgst`).

- **Quiz deep links**: RAG corpus chunks now link to `/learn/quiz?category=<id>` instead of
  the generic `/learn/quiz` path.

- **Module difficulty levels**: All 25 learning modules tagged `beginner`, `intermediate`, or
  `advanced` in `moduleData.ts` (6 beginner, 10 intermediate, 9 advanced).

- **Chat panel export button**: Download icon in the right-panel chat header exports the active
  conversation as formatted Markdown with timestamps and role labels.

- **Textarea UI component**: New shared `<Textarea>` component in `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`
  with semantic tokens (`border-input`, `bg-muted`, `text-foreground`), focus ring, and
  ref forwarding.

- **Document enrichment RAG source**: `document-enrichment` source type in RetrievalService
  with intent-based boost multipliers (definition: 1.2, recommendation: 1.3, country_query: 1.5).

### Changed

- **Landing page**: Hero subtitle rewritten from feature list to problem-solution framing
  ("Quantum computers will break today's encryption..."). Removed the bottom "Open source.
  Free forever." CTA section. `ScoreCard` moved from standalone to embedded inside
  `PersonalizationSection`.

- **ScoreCard**: New `embedded` prop (default `false`) — when true, renders without `motion.section`
  wrapper or `glass-panel` styling for inline embedding.

- **ConversationMenu**: Export and delete buttons are now always visible (removed hover-only
  `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` classes) for better touch device UX.

- **SampleQuestionsModal**: Added `useFocusTrap` hook, `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`,
  `aria-label="Sample questions"`; replaced raw `<button>` elements with `<Button>` component.

- **About page**: Privacy language refined ("No personal data collection" with specific items);
  new "Anonymous usage analytics" section disclosing GA4 tracking (page navigation, feature
  interactions, accuracy signals, learning milestones, assistant feedback) with opt-out link.

- **RAG corpus format**: Output changed from bare JSON array to `{ generatedAt, chunkCount,
chunks }` wrapper. RetrievalService handles both legacy and new formats; exposes `corpusDate`
  getter for freshness tracking.

- **Sitemap**: 9 new learning module URLs added (compliance-strategy, pqc-risk-management,
  pqc-business-case, pqc-governance, vendor-risk, migration-program, code-signing,
  api-security-jwt, iot-ot-pqc); all `<lastmod>` dates updated to 2026-02-28.

- **Compliance data**: Refreshed from NIST, ANSSI, and Common Criteria scrapers.

- **QandA document**: Updated assessment references from 13-step to 14-step; corpus size
  ~2,100 chunks from 24 data sources; new Q7 on document enrichment dimensions.

### Fixed

- **PQC Assistant module count**: Assistant was answering "9 learning modules" instead of 25.
  Root cause: the entity inventory (dynamically built from retrieved RAG chunks, capped at 30
  total entities) was including a truncated subset of modules and the LLM trusted that count
  over the static list in the system prompt. Fix: `modules`, `module-content`, and
  `module-summaries` sources excluded from entity inventory — the hardcoded canonical list
  at system prompt guideline 5 is the authoritative source. System prompt updated to state
  "25 total" explicitly.

- **RAG corpus generator — unquoted object keys**: `processModules()` regex in
  `generate-rag-corpus.ts` required quoted keys (`'module-id':`) but Prettier formats valid
  JS identifiers without quotes (`qkd:`), silently dropping the QKD module from the corpus
  on every regeneration. Regex updated to accept both quoted and unquoted key formats.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **PQC Assistant: multi-conversation history**: Up to 10 concurrent conversations persisted
  across sessions. Conversation switcher menu in the chat panel header with auto-titling from
  the first message. Zustand store migrated from v3 flat messages to v4 conversation-keyed
  shape with full migration guard.

- **PQC Assistant: conversation keyboard navigation**: Arrow Up / Down cycles through
  conversation list; Escape closes the menu; ArrowDown from search input moves focus to
  first conversation. Full ARIA listbox/option role mapping.

- **PQC Assistant: conversation search**: Live search filter appears when 3+ conversations
  exist. Searches both conversation titles and message content.

- **PQC Assistant: conversation export**: Download button (hover-revealed) on each
  conversation exports the full history as formatted Markdown with timestamps and role labels.

- **PQC Assistant: Ask Assistant buttons on 14 surfaces**: Contextual "Ask about this" buttons
  across the app — Algorithm Comparison, Threat Detail, Leader Cards, Compliance Detail,
  Library Detail, Software Catalog, Landing hero, Timeline Gantt popover, and 5 Assessment
  Report sections (Risk Breakdown, HNDL/HNFL, Algorithm Migration, Compliance Impact,
  Recommended Actions). All 25 Learn module cards also get icon-variant Ask buttons.

- **PQC Assistant: response caching**: In-memory LRU cache (20 entries, 5-minute TTL) deduplicates
  identical queries within a session — bypasses RAG retrieval and Gemini API entirely on cache hit.
  True LRU eviction via Map re-insertion on access.

- **PQC Assistant: corpus staleness indicator**: CorpusFreshnessBadge shows an amber warning
  when the RAG corpus is older than 30 days, prompting users to check for data updates.

- **PQC Assistant: persona-aware landing question**: The "Ask the PQC Assistant" button on the
  landing page generates a question tailored to the active persona — developers get integration
  guidance, architects get migration architecture advice, executives get compliance deadlines,
  researchers get mathematical foundations.

- **PQC Assistant: RAG telemetry**: GA4 events for chunk count per query (`RAG Chunks`),
  source diversity (`RAG Source`), and cache hits (`Cache Hit`) — enables measurement of
  retrieval quality and deduplication effectiveness.

### Changed

- **PQC Assistant: PII-safe analytics**: `logChatFeedback` now strips email addresses and URLs
  from query strings before sending to GA4, and truncates to 80 characters. GDPR/CCPA safer.

- **PQC Assistant: error announcements**: Chat panel error container now carries `role="alert"`
  so screen readers announce errors immediately (WCAG 2.1 SC 4.1.3).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Compliance Strategy: country deadlines table**: Ten countries/regions with specific PQC
  migration deadlines — Australia (2030), Canada (2026/2031/2035), UK (2028), Czech Republic
  (2027), EU (2030 Coordinated Roadmap v1.1), Israel (2025), Taiwan (2027), Germany (2030
  QUANTITY initiative), G7 (2034 financial sector). Sourced from finalized 2024–2025 standards.

- **Compliance Strategy: compliance dependencies section**: Five dependency areas — CMVP/FIPS
  140-3 validation backlog, eIDAS 2.0 quantum-safe wallet requirements, Executive Order 14306
  and CISA procurement guidance (January 2026), DORA enforcement (January 2025), and CBOM
  inventory gaps (Europol: 86% of executives unprepared).

- **Compliance Strategy: 13 new jurisdictions**: JurisdictionMapper expanded from ~12 to 24
  jurisdictions — adds Czech Republic, Italy, Spain, New Zealand, China, India, Taiwan, Hong
  Kong, Malaysia, Israel, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Jordan. China conflict detection warns
  about OSCCA/NGCC dual-algorithm requirements; early-deadline countries (AU/TW/CZ) flagged
  against US/EU timelines.

- **IoT/OT: energy budget challenge**: New constraint card — PQC consumes significantly more
  energy; recommends PSK session resumption over repeated full handshakes for battery-constrained
  devices.

- **IoT/OT: Ascon lightweight crypto callout**: Contextualizes NIST's 2023 Ascon selection for
  IoT symmetric-key AEAD as complementary to PQC asymmetric algorithms.

- **IoT/OT: Certificate Chain Bloat Analyzer (Exercise 4)**: New interactive exercise — sets
  full ML-DSA-65 chain (Root + Intermediate + End Entity ≈ 22 KB), then demonstrates Merkle
  Tree Certificates + compression reducing chain to ~3 KB. Total exercises now 5.

- **IoT/OT: three new protocols**: LwM2M + DTLS 1.2/1.3 (1,024 B max, challenging feasibility),
  BLE Mesh (384 B max, problematic for PQC), OPC UA (65,535 B, TCP, good for industrial
  automation).

- **PQC Governance: escalation & conflict resolution framework**: Four-level escalation path —
  Working Group (5 days) → Steering Committee (10 days) → CISO/CTO (5 days) → Board/Risk
  Committee for enterprise risk acceptance.

- **PQC Governance: three new RACI activities**: Training & Awareness, Compliance Auditing,
  Stakeholder Communications added — RACI matrix now covers 10 activities (was 7).

### Changed

- **Compliance Strategy: regulatory content updated**: NSM-10 quote updated to Section 3(a)
  language; CNSA 2.0 timelines distinguish preferred (2025) vs exclusive (2030) for signing;
  NIST IR 8547 reflects draft (November 2024) and finalized (March 2025) versions.

- **IoT/OT: accuracy corrections**: FN-DSA-512 signature size corrected to ~666 avg / 690 max
  bytes; LMS verification speed quantified (~4× faster than XMSS on Cortex-M4). Secure elements
  section added (ARM TrustZone-M, Infineon OPTIGA TPM, Microchip ATECC608).

- **IoT/OT: FirmwareSigningSimulator**: Color-coded verification speed badges (Fastest / Fast /
  Moderate) with semantic status colors replace raw millisecond display.

- **PQC Governance: PolicyTemplateGenerator expanded**: ML-KEM-512 (Category 1), ML-DSA-44
  (Category 2), FN-DSA-512/1024, and HQC-128 (NIST Round 4, draft pending) added to algorithm
  selections. RSA ≥ 3072 clarified in prohibited algorithms list.

- **PQC Governance: RACI cell interaction redesigned**: Click-to-cycle buttons replace select
  dropdowns — cycles R → A → C → I → empty. Validation warning shown when any activity lacks
  an Accountable assignment.

- **PQC Governance: button consistency**: All raw `<button>` elements replaced with `<Button>`
  component variants (destructive / outline / gradient) across Introduction and module nav.

### Fixed

- **Private browsing compatibility**: `localStorage` access in GuidedTour and WhatsNewToast
  wrapped in try-catch — prevents crash when storage is unavailable (Safari private mode,
  hardened browsers). Graceful fallback: tour re-shows, toast suppressed.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- **PQC Assistant: full module coverage**: System prompt now lists all 25 learning modules
  (was 19 — missing Vendor Risk, Compliance Strategy, Migration Program, PQC Risk Management,
  PQC Business Case, PQC Governance). Prevents hallucinated module links.

- **PQC Assistant: persona-aware follow-ups**: LLM-generated follow-up suggestions and
  persona-specific fallbacks (executive/developer/architect/researcher) now render correctly.
  Previously `followUps` and `persona` were never passed to `ChatMessage`.

- **PQC Assistant: module query disambiguation**: "Which module covers TLS?" now correctly
  retrieves learning modules instead of FIPS cryptographic module content.

- **PQC Assistant: country detection expanded**: 16 adjectival country forms (French, Korean,
  German, etc.) now trigger `country_query` intent classification and query expansion.

- **PQC Assistant: prompt size guard**: RAG context blocks capped at 80K characters to prevent
  Gemini API input limit errors on large catalog or quiz result sets.

- **PQC Assistant: safety settings**: Gemini API calls now include explicit safety thresholds
  (`BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH` for harassment/dangerous content) so legitimate cybersecurity discussions
  aren't blocked.

- **PQC Assistant: retry on server errors**: Transient 5xx API errors now retry up to 2 times
  with linear backoff instead of immediately failing.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Career Journey modal**: New interactive career path visualization on the About page,
  replacing the Study Pack ZIP export (StudyPackService and StudyPackCard deleted).

- **Full SLH-DSA coverage**: Playground key store now exposes all 12 FIPS 205 signature
  variants (was 3 — SHA2/SHAKE × 128/192/256 × f/s).

- **Changelog UI redesign**: Structured card layout with category filters (New Features /
  Improvements / Bug Fixes), expandable detail view, and color-coded section bands — replaces
  raw markdown rendering.

### Changed

- **liboqs package migration**: `@openforge-sh/liboqs` v0.14.3 → `@oqs/liboqs-js` v0.15.1
  (same API, new maintainer package). Build scripts and Vite config updated accordingly.

- **Playground dead code removal**: Settings tab and `enabledAlgorithms` state deleted — never
  read by KEM or Sign tabs. Mobile/desktop branching in InteractivePlayground simplified to a
  single render path.

- **ML-KEM algorithm inference refactored**: 4 duplicate inline blocks consolidated into single
  `inferKemAlgorithm()` helper with constant key-size maps for public and private keys.

- **OpenSSL Studio hardening**: FileViewer abort/cleanup pattern prevents stale state updates,
  timeout ref cleanup on unmount in WorkbenchFileManager, structured log cap (500 entries),
  localStorage quota error handling, per-command vs global error distinction in worker, and
  empty catch blocks now surface errors via stderr log.

- **Learning module accuracy corrections**: ES256/ECC P-256 key sizes (32→64/65 bytes), ML-DSA
  signature size (3293→3309), RSA-4096 security bits (152→140), AES-128 deprecation status
  aligned with NIST 2024 assessment, IoT Class 0 specs aligned to RFC 7228, FALCON-512 renamed
  to FN-DSA-512, NIST IR 8547 "Draft" label removed (finalized), CNSA 2.0 milestone
  descriptions corrected.

- **Standards references updated**: RFC 9701 (Token Status List), RFC 9370 (IKEv2 Additional
  Key Exchange), RFC 7228 (IoT device classes), RFC 8784 (PQC PSK for IKEv2).

- **Software catalog refresh**: Go crypto/mlkem timeline corrected (Go 1.24 initial release),
  Apple PQ3/iOS 17.4 baseline clarified, Android 16 status revised to Pending Verification,
  OpenSSH v10.0 hybrid default, Cisco IOS XE and Juniper Junos OS PQC capabilities updated.

- **Semantic token compliance**: Hardcoded colors (amber, gray) replaced with design system
  tokens (`text-status-warning`, `bg-muted`, `border-border`) across OpenSSL Studio,
  Playground, and Migrate components.

- **Responsive breakpoints**: Algorithm comparison shifted from `md:` to `lg:` breakpoint for
  better desktop experience.

- **Typography normalization**: `font-bold` → `font-semibold` across component headings for
  consistent visual hierarchy.

- **RAG corpus regenerated**: Reduced and refreshed to match current content.

### Fixed

- **Playground sessionStorage crash**: Try-catch wrapping prevents errors in private browsing
  and sandboxed iframe environments.

- **KEM ciphertext validation**: Safer split + length checks prevent IndexError on malformed
  hybrid ciphertexts; secret comparison now checks array length before comparing.

- **ZIP key import resilience**: Per-file error handling prevents a single corrupt file from
  aborting the entire import; import count now uses actual array length.

- **OpenSSL worker silent failures**: Empty catch blocks now surface error messages via stderr
  log for file read and directory scan failures.

- **Command race condition**: `isProcessing` guard prevents double-submission in OpenSSL
  Studio's `executeCommand`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Threats × Learn cross-reference**: Each threat card now shows "Learn More" module chips
  linking directly to relevant learning modules. All 79 threats mapped to 1–4 module slugs via
  new `related_modules` column in the threats CSV.

- **Full industry threat coverage**: `INDUSTRY_TO_THREATS_MAP` expanded from `string | null`
  to `string[]`, folding 10 previously invisible threat industries (Cloud Computing, IoT,
  Insurance, Payment Card Industry, Legal/eSignature, Media/DRM, Supply Chain, Rail/Transit,
  Cryptocurrency/Blockchain, Water/Wastewater) into existing landing-page categories. Selecting
  "Finance & Banking" now surfaces PCI, Insurance, and Crypto threats; "Technology" surfaces
  Cloud, IoT, Media, and Supply Chain threats; "Energy & Utilities" surfaces Water/Wastewater
  threats; "Automotive" surfaces Rail/Transit threats.

- **Threats reference downloader** (`scripts/download-threats.js`): New Node.js script mirrors
  the library and timeline downloaders — reads `source_url` from the latest threats CSV, skips
  generic portals and paywalls, caches to `public/threats/`, writes `manifest.json`. Run via
  `npm run download:threats` (or `download:threats:dry` for a dry run).

### Changed

- **Threat source references upgraded**: 27 threats upgraded from generic organization homepage
  URLs to specific document/standard pages (e.g., `rtca.org` → `rtca.org/security/`,
  `dcsa.org` → `dcsa.org/standards/bill-of-lading`). `accuracy_pct` raised from 70% to
  75–80% for all 27 entries. New CSV: `quantum_threats_hsm_industries_02282026.csv`.

- **Threat source URL corrections** (accuracy verification pass): Fixed TELCO-002 GSMA URL,
  CROSS-001/003 IBM IBV report URL, MEDIA-003 DVB CA standards URL, CLOUD-004 CSRC URL format,
  IOT-004 source title mismatch.

- **Education removed from all touchpoints**: Industry option removed from the landing page
  personalization panel, assessment wizard, compliance abbreviation map, breach cost model, and
  scenario simulator. It had no matching threat data and produced empty report sections.

- **Executive module accuracy improvements**:
  - ROI Calculator breach cost baselines refreshed from IBM Cost of Data Breach Report 2024
    (Healthcare: $10.93M → $9.77M; Finance: $5.9M → $6.08M; Government: $4.15M → $2.76M).
  - Policy Template Generator: FrodoKEM label corrected to "(NIST IR 8413 candidate —
    pre-standard)"; Ed25519/Ed448 moved from "prohibited" to "migration required" with
    FIPS 186-5 + Shor's algorithm notes.
  - CRQC Scenario Planner: SHA-256 Grover analysis expanded with precise bit-security figures
    citing NIST IR 8547; compliance deadline array updated with 2025 CNSA 2.0 software/firmware
    entry and advisory flags for EU/ANSSI guidance.
  - Vendor Risk contract clause deadline options revised to match CNSA 2.0 timeline accurately.
  - Compliance Strategy Introduction: FIPS numbers added to CNSA 2.0 and BSI descriptions;
    key dates table updated (2024 NIST IR 8547, 2030 ANSSI advisory).
  - Migration Program Introduction: CISA quote converted to attributed prose.

- **ComplianceTimelineBuilder + RoadmapBuilder**: Year range upper bound now dynamic
  (`Math.max(2036, currentYear + 10)`) — always extends at least 10 years into the future.

- **Quiz question count**: Landing page learn step updated to reflect 470 questions.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **CSV cross-reference validator** (`scripts/validate-csv-refs.ts`): New TypeScript script that
  validates `compliance.library_refs → library.reference_id`, `compliance.timeline_refs →
Country:OrgName pairs`, and `library.dependencies → library.reference_id`. Exits non-zero on
  broken compliance↔library/timeline links. Run via `npm run validate:csv-refs`.

- **Timeline download scripts**: `npm run download:timeline` and `npm run download:timeline:dry`
  added to `package.json` for downloading timeline reference documents.

### Changed

- **`useChatSend`** (`src/hooks/useChatSend.ts`): Input truncated to 1,000 characters before
  submission, preventing large-paste denial-of-service. Timeout error now surfaces as
  `'Request timed out. Please try again.'` instead of silently failing.

- **`download-library.js`**: Skips re-downloading documents already cached on disk. Now writes
  output to a new date-stamped CSV file (e.g., `library_MMDDYYYY.csv`) rather than editing the
  source file in place, per CSV maintenance policy.

- **RAG corpus** (`public/data/rag-corpus.json`): Regenerated with refreshed retrieval sources.

- **Data refresh**: Library, compliance, and quantum-safe software reference CSVs updated to
  March 2026 versions. Older versions archived to `src/data/archive/`.

### Fixed

- **Chatbot timeout UX**: Users now see an explicit error message when the 60-second RAG
  request window expires, rather than the request silently failing.

- **Input validation**: Oversized inputs (>1,000 chars) are now truncated before being sent
  to the retrieval service, preventing unexpected API failures.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Executive Learning Track** — 6 new modules for CISOs and business leaders: PQC Risk Management
  (risk registers, CRQC heatmaps), PQC Business Case (ROI models, breach cost simulators, board
  decks), PQC Governance & Policy (RACI matrices, KPI dashboards), Compliance & Regulatory Strategy
  (multi-jurisdiction audit checklists), Migration Program Management (roadmaps with country
  deadlines), and Vendor & Supply Chain Risk (vendor scorecards, contract clause generators). Each
  module includes interactive artifact builders with CSV/Markdown export.

- **Executive component library** (`src/components/PKILearning/common/executive/`): Reusable
  ArtifactBuilder, BreachCostModel, DataDrivenScorecard, TimelinePlanner, HeatmapGrid, and
  ExportableArtifact components shared across all executive modules.

- **Right Panel system** (`src/components/RightPanel/`): Multi-tab sidebar with Chat (RAG chatbot)
  and History (day-grouped activity timeline with module starts, completions, artifact generation,
  assessments, and belt progression). Replaces standalone ChatFAB with unified RightPanelFAB.

- **Activity history tracking** (`useHistoryStore`): Persisted event log (max 500 events, 16 event
  types) with automatic seeding from existing module, assessment, TLS, and persona stores on first
  launch.

- **Time-based quiz selection**: Replaced fixed Quick Quiz (20 questions) and Full Assessment (80
  questions) with an adjustable time slider (5–45 min, default 15 min). System calculates question
  count at ~45 sec/question. Quick Pick button for 5-minute quizzes. Adaptive category spread
  ensures topic breadth even for short quizzes.

- **6 new quiz categories**: `pqc-risk-management`, `pqc-business-case`, `pqc-governance`,
  `compliance-strategy`, `migration-program`, `vendor-risk` — matching the new executive modules.

- **Module deep linking** (`useModuleDeepLink`): URL parameter support for `?tab=learn|workshop` and
  `?step=<n>` across all learning modules. Chatbot responses now link directly to specific workshop
  steps.

- **Executive document storage**: 15 artifact types (ROI model, risk register, RACI matrix, vendor
  scorecard, policy draft, etc.) persisted in module store with history tracking.

- **Glossary expansion**: Added KPI, RACI Matrix, TCO, and ROI terms for executive audiences.

### Changed

- **Persona paths**: Executive persona learning path expanded from 180 to 270+ minutes with 5
  checkpoints covering all 6 new executive modules.

- **Module catalog**: Expanded to 23 modules across 6 tracks (new Executive track added). Centralized
  MODULE_CATALOG, MODULE_TRACKS, and MODULE_STEP_COUNTS in `moduleData.ts`.

- **GeminiService**: `streamResponse()` now accepts `PageContext` object (page, tab, step) instead of
  plain string, enabling workshop-step-aware chatbot responses.

- **Analytics**: Module start/complete and artifact generation events now auto-log to history store.
  `logStepComplete()` accepts optional `workshopStep` for accurate deep link generation.

- **Module store v5**: Added `executiveDocuments` array to artifacts with auto-migration from v4.

- **ScoreCard**: Simplified layout, removed cloud sync UI, focused on judo belt progression.

- **Data updates**: Library CSV and quantum-safe software reference CSV updated with latest NIST
  FIPS 140-3 PQC guidance and vendor certification statuses.

### Fixed

- **Quiz question selection**: Quick Quiz was too long at 20 questions (~15 min). New time slider
  lets users choose exactly how much time they have, starting from 5-minute quick picks.

- **Storage rehydration guards**: Assessment and persona stores now properly handle corrupted
  localStorage without crashing.

- **Workshop deep links**: Chatbot now generates `?tab=workshop&step=N` links instead of generic
  module links.

## [1.38.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **RAG retrieval optimization** (Rounds 2–5): Multi-turn conversation context injects last 3 user
  messages as supplementary search terms. Intent-aware diversity caps (60% for comparison/catalog/
  country queries). Source boost tuning — transitions 3× for comparisons, documentation 1.5× for
  recommendations, library 1.2× for country queries, leaders 1.5× for definitions. System prompt
  optimized (47 → 17 guideline lines, ~400 tokens reclaimed). Corpus expanded from 1,712 to 1,727
  chunks: 13 assessment guide, 3 getting-started, 4 playground guide, 3 OpenSSL Studio guide, and
  certifications expanded from 3 to 13 vendor-level chunks.

- **Source attribution UI** (`ChatMessage.tsx`, `ChatPanel.tsx`, `ChatTypes.ts`): Assistant messages
  now show a collapsible source list with deep-linked titles. Click any source to navigate directly
  to the relevant page. Sources are deduplicated by title.

- **Follow-up question suggestions** (`ChatMessage.tsx`): Entity-aware follow-up chips appear below
  the last assistant response. Regex-based extraction detects algorithm names, FIPS standards,
  vendor/product names, and learning module topics, then maps them to contextual follow-up templates.
  Capped at 3 suggestions.

- **Curated suggested questions** (`usePageContext.ts`): All 18 learning modules now have hand-written
  suggested questions (previously 10/18 used generic templates). Added: VPN & SSH, Email Signing, PKI
  Workshop, Merkle Tree Certs, API Security & JWT, Code Signing, Digital Identity, IoT & OT Security.

- **Clear conversation confirmation** (`ChatPanel.tsx`): Trash button now requires `confirm()` before
  clearing messages. Matches existing `window.confirm()` pattern used across the codebase.

- **40 golden query tests** (`golden-queries.test.ts`): Expanded from 21 to 40 regression tests
  covering definitions, comparisons, catalog lookups, country queries, recommendations, and
  cross-intent queries. Metrics: 100% Intent Accuracy, 93.1% Recall@5, 100% Recall@15, 94.9%
  Source Coverage, 0% Noise Rate.

### Fixed

- **ChatFAB mobile position** (`ChatFAB.tsx`): Fixed Tailwind class ordering — mobile-first
  `bottom-20 right-4` with `md:bottom-6 md:right-6` override. Previous classes had conflicting
  order that was accidentally working.

- **Streaming accessibility** (`ChatPanel.tsx`): Added `aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="false"`
  to the messages container so screen readers announce streaming text progressively.

## [1.37.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Precision deep-link entry points** (8 views): Library `?ref=`, Threats `?id=`, Learn modules
  `?tab=workshop`, Algorithms `?highlight=` (highlights in both Overview and Detailed Comparison
  tabs), Compliance `?cert=`, Assess `?step=`, Playground `?algo=`, Leaders
  `?leader=`/`?sector=`/`?country=`. All entry points include `useEffect` sync for same-route
  navigations (chatbot deep links).

- **RAG deep-link integration** (`scripts/generate-rag-corpus.ts`, `GeminiService.ts`): 95% of RAG
  corpus chunks (1,643/1,725) now carry pre-computed `deepLink` URLs. Gemini system prompt guideline
  #4 instructs the model to always use the deep link from context chunks, producing more precise
  navigation links in chatbot responses.

- **PQC Assistant section in About page** (`AboutView.tsx`, `MobileAboutView.tsx`): New section
  explaining the RAG architecture, Gemini 2.5 Flash integration, BYOK API key requirement
  (with link to Google AI Studio), three capability cards (Grounded Answers, Deep Linking, PQC
  Domain Expertise), and four limitations.

- **Sample Questions modal** (`SampleQuestionsModal.tsx`, `ChatPanel.tsx`): `?` button in the chat
  panel header opens a categorized question bank (22 questions across 11 categories — Library,
  Threats, Learn, Algorithms, Compliance, Assessment, Playground, Leaders, Timeline, Migrate,
  Cross-cutting). Click any question to copy it to clipboard for pasting into the chatbot.

### Fixed

- **3 pre-existing test failures** (`LeadersGrid.test.tsx`, `LibraryView.test.tsx`,
  `TimelineView.test.tsx`): Added missing `useSearchParams` mocks to fix 49 tests that were failing
  before this release.

## [1.36.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **PQC Assistant chatbot** (`src/components/Chat/`, `src/services/chat/`): Gemini 2.5 Flash-powered
  conversational AI with client-side RAG retrieval. Three-phase search (entity matching → query
  expansion → keyword with source diversity) draws from 1,725 chunks across 17 data sources
  (glossary, algorithms, threats, timeline, library, compliance, migrate catalog, leaders, quiz,
  assessment, certifications, priority matrix, authoritative sources, documentation, and all 19
  learning modules). Streaming markdown responses with SPA-aware internal link navigation. Floating
  action button + slide-in panel. BYOK model — users provide their own Gemini API key.

- **Deep-linking across all pages**: Library, Compliance, Timeline, and Leaders views now accept
  `?q=` search params to pre-filter on load. Chatbot system prompt instructs the model to deep-link
  all mentioned items: products via `/migrate?q=`, algorithms via `/algorithms?highlight=`,
  industry threats via `/threats?industry=`, library docs via `/library?q=`, compliance frameworks
  via `/compliance?q=`, timeline countries via `/timeline?q=`, and leaders via `/leaders?q=`.

- **RAG corpus generators** (`scripts/generate-rag-corpus.ts`): 4 new CSV processors — quiz Q&A
  (138 chunks from 380 questions grouped by category), assessment config (3 chunks), migration
  priority matrix (4 chunks), and certification cross-references (3 chunks). Combined with learning
  module content extraction (258 chunks) and markdown documentation (70 chunks), the corpus grew
  from 1,249 to 1,725 chunks (1.44 MB).

- **Study Pack for NotebookLM** (`src/services/export/StudyPackService.ts`,
  `src/components/About/StudyPackCard.tsx`): Downloadable ZIP file containing all PQC Today content
  (glossary, algorithms, library, threats, compliance, migrate catalog, leaders, timeline, learning
  modules) as structured markdown files for use with Google NotebookLM.

- **Data Privacy section** (`AboutView.tsx`, `MobileAboutView.tsx`): New section on the About page
  explaining the app's privacy model — no server-side data collection, localStorage-only
  persistence, BYOK API key handling, and educational-use crypto disclaimer.

### Fixed

- **Broken deep links from Assessment Report**: Report → Library used `?search=` but Library reads
  `?q=` (param name mismatch, links landed with empty search). Report → Timeline sent `?country=`
  but TimelineView never consumed it (country not pre-selected). Report → Migrate sent `?industry=`
  but MigrateView ignored it (no industry filtering applied).

- **Timeline `?country=` deep link** (`TimelineView.tsx`): URL param now pre-selects the country
  dropdown, validated against available timeline data before applying.

- **Migrate `?industry=` deep link** (`MigrateView.tsx`): New `industryFilter` state filters
  products by `targetIndustries` field. Dismissible banner shows the active industry filter,
  following the existing step-filter pattern.

## [1.35.0] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Global mobile UX audit — touch targets** (41 files): Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA remediation
  across every page and component. All interactive elements now meet the 44×44px minimum touch
  target requirement. Key changes: `min-h-[44px]` added to filter buttons in `ChangelogView`,
  phase dots in `MobileTimelineList`, answer buttons in `QuestionCard`, link buttons in
  `LeaderCard`, the `FilterDropdown` trigger, and the `SourcesModal` close button. Button
  component `sm` size increased from `h-9` (36px) to `h-10` (40px); `icon` size from
  `h-10 w-10` to `h-11 w-11` (44px) globally via `button-variants.ts`.

- **Dynamic viewport height for modals** (`ScoringModal`, `SourcesModal`,
  `ReportMethodologyModal`): Changed `max-h-[85vh]` → `max-h-[85dvh]` so modals remain fully
  scrollable in landscape mode on phones where the browser address bar reduces available height.
  Suspense fallback in `MainLayout` likewise changed from `h-[50vh]` → `min-h-[200px] h-[50dvh]`.

- **Safe-area inset support** (`MainLayout.tsx`, `src/styles/index.css`): Sticky app header now
  uses `top-[max(1rem,env(safe-area-inset-top))]` to clear iPhone notch / Dynamic Island. New
  `.safe-top` CSS utility added for reuse.

- **Tabs overflow on all Learn modules** (`src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`): `TabsList` gained
  `overflow-x-auto no-scrollbar w-full`; `TabsTrigger` gained `shrink-0`. Fixes tab bar
  compression/overflow on all 16 learning module pages.

- **Module workshop landscape mode** (18 module files): Content panels changed from
  `min-h-[600px]` → `min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[600px]` so workshop areas remain usable on
  landscape phones where viewport height can be as low as 320px.

- **QKD BB84 Simulator** (`modules/QKD/workshop/BB84Simulator.tsx`): Qubit grid wrapped in
  `overflow-x-auto` with `min-w-max` on the inner grid to prevent clipping on narrow screens;
  Eve interception slider widened from `w-16` → `w-24` for easier finger dragging.

- **Report page** (`ReportContent.tsx`, `ReportThreatsAppendix.tsx`): Risk gauge SVG scaled
  down on mobile (`w-32 h-20 md:w-48 md:h-28`). Threat Landscape table minimum width reduced
  from `min-w-[560px]` → `min-w-[400px]`; "Crypto at Risk" column hidden on mobile
  (`hidden md:table-cell`) to reduce horizontal scroll distance.

- **Threats page** (`ThreatsDashboard.tsx`, `MobileThreatsList.tsx`): Search bar changed from
  `hidden md:flex` to always-visible (`flex w-full md:flex-1`) so mobile users can filter
  threats. Stat chip grid changed from `grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 min-[360px]:grid-cols-2`
  to prevent overflow on sub-360px devices.

- **Compliance dropdowns** (`ComplianceTable.tsx`): Source, Category, and Vendor filter menus
  gained `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` so they cannot overflow off-screen on 320–375px viewports.

- **Misc layout fixes**: `SoftwareTable` expanded row label column changed from
  `grid-cols-[120px_1fr]` → `grid-cols-[100px_1fr] sm:grid-cols-[120px_1fr]`; `Changelog`
  filter row changed from `flex-wrap` → `flex-col sm:flex-row` so buttons stack cleanly on
  mobile; `MobileTimelineList` phase indicator dots enlarged to 44×44px touch target; Landing
  page journey step rail gained a right-edge fade gradient scroll affordance.

## [1.34.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Standalone Report view** (`/report`, `src/components/Report/`): Extracted the PQC Risk
  Assessment report from `AssessView` into its own dedicated route. `ReportView` accepts URL
  query parameters to auto-hydrate and auto-complete assessments, enabling fully shareable report
  links. `ReportContent` consolidates all report sections — Risk Score gauge (SVG needle),
  Category Breakdown, HNDL/HNFL risk windows, Algorithm Migration priorities, Compliance Impact,
  Recommended Actions, Migration Roadmap, and Threat Landscape — into a single 1 700-line
  component with persona-aware section visibility and print/PDF support. `MigrationToolkit`
  section surfaces curated software products directly from the Migrate catalog.

- **Code Signing module** (`/learn/code-signing`, `src/components/PKILearning/modules/CodeSigning/`):
  New 5-step workshop covering PQC supply chain security. **Step 1 – Binary Signing**: sign/verify
  arbitrary payloads with ML-DSA-87 and compare classical ECDSA P-384 byte overhead. **Step 2 –
  Certificate Chain**: build a PQC certificate hierarchy (root CA → intermediate → leaf) with
  ML-DSA. **Step 3 – Package Signing**: RPM-style hybrid package signing with ML-DSA-87 + Ed448
  dual signatures. **Step 4 – Sigstore Flow**: keyless signing via Sigstore transparency-log
  workflow including inclusion proof visualization. **Step 5 – Secure Boot Chain**: interactive
  4-stage boot chain visualization comparing LMS, XMSS, and ML-DSA firmware signing algorithms
  with stateful signature counter tracking and CNSA 2.0 mandate timelines.

- **API Security & JWT module** (`/learn/api-security-jwt`,
  `src/components/PKILearning/modules/APISecurityJWT/`): New 5-step workshop covering JWT/JWS/JWE
  with post-quantum algorithms. **Step 1 – JWT Inspector**: decode and inspect any JWT with
  algorithm vulnerability analysis (flags RS256/HS256 as quantum-vulnerable). **Step 2 – PQC JWT
  Signing**: sign JWTs with ML-DSA-87 and compare to RS256 signature byte sizes. **Step 3 –
  Hybrid JWT**: dual-sign with classical (Ed25519) + PQC (ML-DSA-87) for backward-compatible
  migration tokens. **Step 4 – JWE Encryption**: encrypt JWT payloads with ML-KEM-768 key
  agreement. **Step 5 – Token Size Analyzer**: side-by-side header/payload/signature byte
  breakdown for RS256, ES256, ML-DSA-44/65/87.

- **IoT & OT Security module** (`/learn/iot-ot-pqc`,
  `src/components/PKILearning/modules/IoTOT/`): New 5-step workshop covering PQC challenges for
  constrained devices. **Step 1 – Constrained Algorithm Explorer**: algorithm selection for
  RFC 7228 Class 0/1/2 devices with memory and compute constraints. **Step 2 – Firmware Signing
  Simulator**: LMS/XMSS stateful signature signing with state counter tracking. **Step 3 – DTLS
  Handshake Visualizer**: DTLS 1.3 protocol visualization with PQC impact analysis. **Step 4 –
  SCADA Migration Planner**: ICS migration strategy across Purdue Model levels. **Step 5 – Cert
  Chain Bloat Analyzer**: certificate size impact analysis for constrained device environments.

- **Belt-ranked Learning Journey scorecard** (`src/components/Landing/ScoreCard.tsx`): Replaced
  linear progress display with a 7-tier judo belt ranking system (White → Yellow → Orange → Green
  → Blue → Brown → Black). Composite 0–100 score is computed across 4 weighted dimensions:
  Knowledge 40% (quiz accuracy), Breadth 30% (step completion %), Practice 20% (artifacts
  created), Consistency 10% (time + day streak). Threshold gating prevents belt advancement
  without meeting all dimension minimums. Streak tracking with 2–7 day flame badge. Cloud sync
  UI surface (upload/download via Google Drive) with last-synced timestamp.

- **Awareness Score hook** (`src/hooks/useAwarenessScore.ts`): New 490-line hook computing the
  belt-rank score. Returns `AwarenessScoreResult` with score, belt rank, next-belt gap, 4-
  dimension breakdown (raw + weighted), track-level progress, and streak data. Persona-scoped —
  filters modules/questions to the active persona's learning path. Cumulative quiz mastery tracks
  correct question IDs across sessions; streak inferred from `sessionTracking` daily-visit log.

- **Google Drive cloud sync** (`src/services/storage/GoogleDriveService.ts`,
  `src/services/storage/UnifiedStorageService.ts`, `src/store/useCloudSyncStore.ts`): Privacy-
  first cloud persistence layer. `GoogleDriveService` uses Google Identity Services implicit flow
  with `drive.appdata` scope — stores access tokens in-memory only (never written to
  localStorage). Progress saved to a single JSON file in Google Drive's hidden `appDataFolder`
  (invisible to the user's Drive file list). `UnifiedStorageService` aggregates all Zustand stores
  into a typed `AppSnapshot` (version 1.0) with Uint8Array serialization, and exports/imports
  JSON snapshots. `useCloudSyncStore` (version 1, persisted) tracks sync state: enabled, provider,
  `lastSyncedAt`, `lastSyncDirection`.

- **Persistent Migrate layer/subcategory filters** (`src/store/useMigrateSelectionStore.ts`):
  Version bump to v2 adds `activeLayer` and `activeSubCategory` fields. Selected infrastructure
  layer and sub-category now survive page reloads. `MigrateView` reads/writes via the store;
  migration guard in `migrate()` provides safe defaults for existing v1 persisted state.

- **CBOM Scanner enhancements** (`CBOMScanner.tsx`, `cbomTemplates.ts`): Major expansion of the
  Crypto Agility module's CBOM tooling. New dependency graph visualization, expanded template
  library (20+ templates covering cloud, container, API gateway, microservice, and IoT stacks),
  per-asset migration effort scoring, and CSV/JSON export of the bill of materials.

- **Tools & Products tab** in all learning modules: New "Tools & Products" tab next to References
  surfaces PQC-ready products from the Migrate catalog that are relevant to each module. Products are
  grouped by infrastructure layer with compact cards showing PQC support badge, FIPS validation
  status, license type, product brief, and a "View in Migrate" deep-link that pre-selects the
  matching layer. Powered by a new `learning_modules` column in the migrate CSV (177/223 products
  tagged across 34 categories) and a shared `ModuleMigrateTab` component. Multi-layer products
  appear in all matching layer sections.

- **Report contextual actions** (`src/components/Report/ReportContent.tsx`): Algorithm replacement
  rows now include "Learn" links to relevant modules (ML-KEM/ML-DSA → PKI Workshop, SLH-DSA/LMS →
  Stateful Signatures, Hybrid → Hybrid Crypto). Timeline section links to country-filtered
  timeline view. Footer actions link to full algorithm comparison and compliance explorer pages.

- **Module cross-navigation** in 10 learning module introductions: "Explore Related Topics" cards
  linking to related modules (e.g., Hybrid Crypto → API Security & JWT, MTC → TLS Basics,
  PQC 101 → Entropy & Randomness, Quantum Threats → Digital Assets, TLS → 5G Security).

- **Glossary expansion**: 6 new IoT/OT terms (MQTT, LoRaWAN, Matter, SUIT/RFC 9019, RFC 7228,
  Purdue Model) plus UEFI for Secure Boot. Existing SCADA and DTLS entries relinked to IoT module.

- **Updated algorithm + software CSVs**: Refreshed `algorithms_transitions_02252026.csv` and
  `algorithms_transitions_02262026.csv` (RSA → ML-KEM, ECDSA → ML-DSA, ECDH → HQC deprecation
  dates). New `pqc_complete_algorithm_reference_02252026.csv` with 15-column algorithm reference
  including performance benchmarks (keygen/sign/verify cycles) and stack RAM per security level.
  New `quantum_safe_cryptographic_software_reference_02272026.csv` and `_02282026.csv` featuring
  BTQ Bitcoin Quantum (ML-DSA), Hitachi DoMobile (FIPS 203 ML-KEM), Solana PQC testnet, SEALSQ
  Quantum Shield, QuSecure, SandboxAQ, and 01 Quantum IronCAP.

- **Library catalog refresh** (`library_02252026.csv`): Korean PQC Competition finalists
  (HAETAE, AIMer, SMAUG-T, NTRU+), NIST FIPS 140-3 PQC implementation guidance, 3GPP PQC study,
  TPM 2.0 PQC specification, 10+ new IETF RFCs (9629, 9708, 9802, 9810, 9814, 9858, 9881, 9882),
  ETSI hybrid key exchange and migration specs, NSA CNSA 2.0 policy with implementation timelines.

### Changed

- **`AssessView` simplified** (`src/components/Assess/AssessView.tsx`): Report rendering removed
  from AssessView; on completion the wizard navigates to `/report` instead of showing an inline
  report. Assessment mode selection (Quick vs Comprehensive) and resume banner retained. Reduces
  `AssessView` from ~650 to ~400 lines.

- **`StepIndicator` redesigned** (`src/components/Assess/steps/StepIndicator.tsx`): Overhauled
  step navigation rail with improved active/completed state styling, mobile-responsive step labels,
  and per-step metadata badges.

- **`ScoringModal` updated** (`src/components/Landing/ScoringModal.tsx`): Now explains the 4-
  dimension belt-rank scoring breakdown with threshold gating details and a per-belt requirements
  table.

- **`PersonalizationSection` updated** (`src/components/Landing/PersonalizationSection.tsx`):
  Refreshed layout to accommodate the new ScoreCard belt display and cloud sync status indicator.

- **`MigrateView` refactored** (`src/components/Migrate/MigrateView.tsx`): Layer and sub-category
  filter state moved from local `useState` to `useMigrateSelectionStore` for persistence.
  `InfrastructureStack` click handler now dispatches to the store. Per-layer product counts
  computed from filtered software data.

- **Learn module tracks reorganized** (`src/components/PKILearning/moduleData.ts`): `code-signing`
  and `iot-ot-pqc` added to the Applications track; `api-security-jwt` added to the Protocols
  track. Module step counts table updated for all new modules.

- **Assessment wizard Step 3 refactored** (`src/components/Assess/steps/Step3Crypto.tsx`):
  Switched from `pqcAlgorithmsData` to the algorithms transition table. Chips now display
  classical → PQC replacement pairs with category-aware grouping. Added "Compare algorithms" link
  to the full algorithm database at `/algorithms`.

- **Assessment scoring engine expanded** (`src/hooks/assessmentData.ts`, `assessmentUtils.ts`):
  Algorithm DB now includes 9 quantum-safe PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, LMS/HSS,
  XMSS) with hybrid recommendations. Country regulatory urgency expanded from 10 to 20+ countries
  with source citations. Composite score boost factors refactored from multiplicative stacking to
  additive increments capped at 1.2x. Unknown algorithms now treated as quantum-vulnerable.

- **Persona learning paths expanded** (`src/data/learningPersonas.ts`): All four personas updated
  with new modules (merkle-tree-certs, digital-id, iot-ot-pqc) and expanded checkpoints.
  Developer duration 705→855 min, Architect 765→1095 min, Researcher 1080→1230 min.

- **Library view layout** (`src/components/Library/LibraryView.tsx`): Category sidebar refactored
  from vertical sticky sidebar to horizontal pill layout for better mobile/desktop responsiveness.
  Grid breakpoints expanded to 4-column layout at xl.

- **Store persistence hardened**: Added explicit `version`, `migrate()`, and `onRehydrateStorage`
  crash guards to OpenSSL Studio, TLS Learning, Theme, and Version stores. Assessment store
  migrations reordered and extended (v5–v7) for infrastructure validation and algorithm renaming.

- **Landing page dynamic counts** (`src/components/Landing/LandingView.tsx`): Module count,
  quiz question count, and tool count now derived from data sources instead of hardcoded values.

## [1.33.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **PQC Live Comparison Demo** (`DigitalAssets/PQCMigrationFlow`, `PQCLiveComparisonFlow`): Added
  Part 5 "Try It Live" to the PQC Defense workshop flow in the Digital Assets module. Users can
  now run real ML-DSA-65 and secp256k1 crypto operations side-by-side in the browser via OpenSSL
  WASM v3.6.0. Three-step interactive wizard: (1) key generation with real PEM byte size
  comparison, (2) signing the same message with both algorithms and a CSS bar chart showing the
  ~46× signature size difference, (3) verifying both signatures with a live BIP-360 witness
  overhead calculation. secp256k1 signing uses `-rawin -digest sha256` to handle raw messages
  (ECDSA expects a pre-computed digest by default); ML-DSA-65 handles arbitrary-length messages
  natively per FIPS 204. No liboqs required — OpenSSL 3.6.0 natively supports ML-DSA-44/65/87.

- **`ML_DSA_65` command templates** (`DigitalAssets/constants.ts`): Added `ML_DSA_65` command
  group alongside existing `BITCOIN`, `ETHEREUM`, `SOLANA` groups with `GEN_KEY`, `EXTRACT_PUB`,
  `SIGN`, and `VERIFY` helpers for OpenSSL ML-DSA-65 operations.

## [1.32.0] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Glossary tooltip overflow clipping** (`InlineTooltip`, all 16 learning modules): Tooltips
  were silently clipped inside any container with `overflow: hidden` or `overflow-y: auto`
  (TLS panel glass-panels, PKIWorkshop modal bodies, DigitalID scroll container, FiveG diagram
  wrappers, DigitalAssets step wizard). Fixed by switching from `position: absolute` (relative
  to nearest positioned ancestor) to `ReactDOM.createPortal()` rendering into `document.body`
  with `position: fixed` coordinates computed from `getBoundingClientRect()`. Z-index raised to
  `9999` via inline style. A scroll event listener (window capture phase) closes the tooltip
  when the page scrolls, preventing stale-position display.

- **DigitalAssets `InfoTooltip` and local `InlineTooltip` clipping** (`modules/DigitalAssets`):
  Applied the same portal + fixed positioning fix to both exported components in the module-local
  `InfoTooltip.tsx`. Arrow decorations removed since they don't work with fixed positioning.

- **DigitalID `InfoTooltip` clipping** (`modules/DigitalID`): Applied portal + fixed positioning
  fix. Added above/below smart positioning (the original always rendered below regardless of
  viewport space).

### Added

- **`SCT` glossary term** (`glossaryData.ts`): Signed Certificate Timestamp was used in the
  Merkle Tree Certs module (`<InlineTooltip term="SCT">`) but had no glossary entry, causing
  the tooltip to silently render as plain text. Added with a complete definition covering CT log
  membership proofs and the relationship to MTC inclusion proofs.

## [1.31.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Full SEO overhaul**: Per-route metadata for all 31 pages — unique titles, descriptions,
  canonical URLs, Open Graph tags, and Twitter Card tags dynamically rendered using React 19's
  native document metadata hoisting. No external dependency required.

- **Playwright-based prerendering**: All 31 routes now generate static HTML at build time via
  `scripts/prerender.mjs`. Crawlers receive real rendered content (navigation, headings, page text)
  without executing JavaScript, solving the SPA indexing problem. WASM-heavy interactive content
  still loads client-side after hydration.

- **Expanded sitemap** (`public/sitemap.xml`): Grew from 13 to 31 URLs, now covering all 16
  learning modules (`/learn/pqc-101`, `/learn/quantum-threats`, etc.), `/assess`, `/learn/quiz`,
  and all main routes — each with `<lastmod>` dates for accurate crawl scheduling.

- **Enhanced structured data** (`index.html`, `src/seo/routeMeta.ts`): Homepage now declares a
  `@graph` with `WebSite` (including `SearchAction` for sitelinks search), `Organization` (with
  logo and GitHub sameAs), and `WebApplication` schemas. Individual routes inject page-specific
  JSON-LD: `Course` for the learning hub, `LearningResource` per module, `Dataset` for compliance
  and timeline data, `ItemList` for the algorithm explorer.

- **Journey-oriented descriptions**: Homepage and 5 key pages (`/learn`, `/assess`, `/migrate`,
  `/compliance`, `/timeline`) now carry elevated, mission-driven descriptions that convey the
  end-to-end guided PQC transformation journey — education → risk assessment → migration →
  regulatory compliance alignment.

- **CI prerender support** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): Playwright Chromium is now installed
  before the build step so `scripts/prerender.mjs` runs correctly in the GitHub Actions deploy
  pipeline.

- **`robots.txt` crawl-delay**: Added `Crawl-delay: 1` directive to pace crawler traffic.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Persona-aware assessment report** (`/assess`): Executive persona now sees a streamlined report —
  HNDL/HNFL risk windows and algorithm migration matrix are hidden by default, recommended actions
  are clamped to top 5. A "View full technical report" toggle reveals the complete report.
  Researcher and architect personas get the Industry Threat Landscape section expanded by default.

- **Wizard pre-fill from persona store** (`/assess`): The assessment wizard now auto-fills industry
  and country from the persona/region selections made on the landing page, so users don't re-enter
  data they already provided.

- **Industry filter on Migrate catalog** (`/migrate`): New Industry dropdown filter in the software
  catalog, powered by each product's `targetIndustries` field. Auto-initialized from the
  assessment's industry, persona store, or `?industry=` URL parameter. Includes a filter banner
  with clear button matching the existing layer/step filter pattern.

- **Assessment → Migrate deep link** (`/assess`): "Explore" links on recommended actions pointing
  to `/migrate` now append `?industry=...` so the Migrate catalog auto-filters to industry-relevant
  tools.

### Fixed

- **Chunk loading resilience**: All 30 lazy-loaded routes and modules now use `lazyWithRetry` — a
  wrapper that retries failed dynamic imports up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s)
  and auto-reloads the page as a last resort (once, via sessionStorage guard). Eliminates the
  "page won't load until you manually refresh" issue caused by stale chunks after deploys or
  transient network failures.

- **ErrorBoundary smart recovery**: The "Try again" button now detects chunk load errors
  (`dynamically imported module`, `Failed to fetch`) and performs a full page reload instead of
  just resetting React error state — which was ineffective because React.lazy caches rejected
  promises.

- **WASM promise cache invalidation**: liboqs KEM and signature instance caches (`liboqs_kem.ts`,
  `liboqs_sig.ts`) now evict rejected promises on failure so the next call retries the WASM factory
  instead of permanently returning the same dead promise. Cleanup also catches already-failed
  promises to prevent unhandled rejection warnings.

- **LmsService init race condition**: Concurrent `init()` callers now detect whether the first
  init attempt succeeded or failed, instead of silently returning without a module. Failed script
  elements are removed from the DOM so retries can re-add them.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Industry-weighted composite scoring** (`/assess`): Risk scores now use industry-tailored
  category weights — government and finance boost regulatory pressure (0.30), telecom and energy
  boost migration complexity (0.25), and technology boosts organizational readiness (0.30) — instead
  of fixed weights across all industries.

- **Country planning horizons** (`/assess`): HNDL and HNFL risk windows now use country-specific
  regulatory deadlines (US/France/Canada target 2030, Germany/UK/Australia target 2035) instead of
  a universal 2035 planning horizon. Users in countries with earlier deadlines see more urgent risk
  assessments.

- **Compliance deadline-aware scoring** (`/assess`): Regulatory pressure scoring now parses actual
  deadline years from compliance frameworks. Passed deadlines score 15 points, imminent (≤2 years)
  score 14, near-term (≤5 years) score 12, and distant deadlines score 8 — replacing the previous
  flat per-framework scoring.

- **Category score driver explanations** (`/assess`): Each of the four risk category progress bars
  now shows a human-readable explanation of what drives the score (e.g., "3 vulnerable algorithms,
  high sensitivity, 25-year retention").

- **Industry-specific recommended actions** (`/assess`): Nine industry-tailored actions added —
  from CNSA 2.0 alignment for government to SCADA/OT assessment for energy, V2X planning for
  automotive, and cloud KMS evaluation for technology.

- **Algorithm-highlighted threat landscape** (`/assess`): Threat rows matching the user's selected
  algorithms are now visually highlighted with a primary-colored left border and subtle background.

- **Country-aware migration roadmap** (`/assess`): Roadmap swim lane phases (Immediate, Short-term,
  Long-term) now dynamically compress or expand based on deadline proximity — urgent deadlines
  (≤24 months) compress to 0–3/3–12 months, distant deadlines (≥60 months) expand to 0–12/12–24
  months.

- **Industry-aware retention defaults** (`/assess`): "I don't know" retention answers now use
  industry-specific conservative defaults from CSV data (75 years for government, 40 for aerospace)
  instead of a flat 15-year default.

### Changed

- **Methodology modal accuracy** (`/assess`): Updated risk score description to reflect actual
  industry-tailored weights and deadline proximity scoring. Added country planning horizon context
  to HNDL description. Updated "I don't know" section with industry-specific retention defaults.

- **Country urgency scoring uncapped** (`/assess`): Removed the artificial cap on country regulatory
  urgency contribution, allowing high-urgency countries (US, France) to contribute their full
  weight to the regulatory pressure score.

- **Executive summary country context** (`/assess`): When a user's country has an accelerated
  planning horizon, the executive summary now explicitly mentions the country's target year
  relative to the global planning horizon.

## [1.28.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Report methodology modal** (`/assess`): Info button next to the report title opens a modal
  explaining how the risk score, four risk categories, HNDL/HNFL risk windows, conservative
  defaults for "I don't know" responses, and action prioritization work. Hidden in print view.

### Fixed

- **Compliance impact industry filtering** (`/assess`): Fixed bug where telecom-only compliance
  frameworks (e.g., GSMA NG.116) appeared in Finance industry reports. Changing industry or country
  now clears stale compliance selections, and the scoring engine filters out frameworks that don't
  match the selected industry.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Web Browsers category in Migrate catalog** (`/migrate`): Added Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge,
  Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari (CSC-037) with ML-KEM TLS 1.3 support details. All four tagged
  for both migrate and launch phases. New `02222026.csv` created per CSV maintenance rules.

### Changed

- **Three-tier FIPS validation badge** (`/migrate`): FIPS column now distinguishes between
  FIPS 140/203 certified (green "Validated"), indirect or partial claims like FedRAMP, WebTrust,
  FIPS mode (amber "Partial"), and no validation (gray "No"). Previously any "Yes" value showed
  a misleading green "Validated" badge.

### Fixed

- **CSV line ending normalization**: Fixed mixed CRLF/LF line endings in software reference CSVs
  that caused PapaParse to silently drop rows with quoted comma fields.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Sources button on Compliance page** (`/compliance`): Page header now includes a `SourcesButton`
  giving users direct access to authoritative sources referenced in the compliance landscape.

- **Full header cluster on Migrate page** (`/migrate`): The PQC Migration Catalog page header now
  includes an `ArrowRightLeft` icon, plus `SourcesButton`, `ShareButton`, and `GlossaryButton`,
  completing the standard content-page header pattern across all major views.

- **Share & Glossary buttons on OpenSSL Studio** (`/openssl`): Desktop header now includes
  `ShareButton` and `GlossaryButton` (hidden on mobile), consistent with other tool pages.

### Changed

- **Authoritative sources data model** (`src/data/authoritativeSourcesData.ts`): Added
  `complianceCsv` and `migrateCsv` boolean fields to `AuthoritativeSource`; extended `ViewType`
  to include `'Compliance'` and `'Migrate'`; CSV parser updated to 13 columns with
  `lastVerifiedDate` shifted from index 10 to index 12.

### Fixed

- **Playground page layout** (`/playground`): Description paragraph moved above the button cluster
  so it reads correctly before the action controls rather than inline with them.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Persona-aware journey step rail** (`/`): The landing page now features a horizontal 7-step
  progression rail — Learn → Assess → Explore → Test → Deploy → Ramp Up → Stay Agile —
  replacing the previous feature-grid layout. Inaccessible steps are dimmed at 35% opacity
  based on the active persona; persona-priority steps receive a "For you" badge. Each step card
  shows route chips for all paths (Explore → Timeline / Algorithms / Library; Stay Agile →
  Threats / Leaders; single-path steps show their chip too for visual consistency).

- **Hero messaging refresh** (`/`): Updated hero tagline to "The quantum era is here. Your
  transformation journey starts now." with a new "Your PQC Transformation" headline and
  persona-aware CTA buttons routing each role to its most relevant starting point
  (Executive → Assess, Developer → Playground, Architect → Timeline, Researcher → Algorithms).

### Fixed

- **Landing — path chips on all step cards** (`/`): Route chips previously only rendered on
  multi-path steps (`step.paths.length > 1` guard removed). All 7 journey cards now display
  their chips, giving every step a consistent visual affordance.

- **Landing — step rail connector alignment** (`/`): Vertical connector lines between step circles
  now pin correctly to circle center regardless of card column height (fixed via `items-start` +
  `mt-4` offset on the connector div).

- **Tests — ComplianceView and audit_suci** (`src/`): Resolved pre-existing failures by wrapping
  `render()` calls in `<MemoryRouter>`, correcting the default-tab assertion (`"landscape"` not
  `"all"`), adding `Buffer` to the WASM test `vm` context, and replacing `new Function()` with
  `vm.runInContext()` for safer WASM glue code loading.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Entropy & Randomness quiz category** (`/learn/quiz`): New `entropy-randomness` category with Dice icon covering SP 800-90 A/B/C, DRBG mechanisms, entropy sources, TRNG vs QRNG, and min-entropy estimation. Integrated into Developer, Architect, and Researcher learning personas — quiz paths and checkpoint categories updated; estimated path minutes increased accordingly.

- **BB84 simulator — configurable Eve interception rate** (`/learn`): Eve eavesdropping is no longer all-or-nothing. A slider (10%–100%) controls the fraction of qubits Eve intercepts, enabling partial-eavesdropping experiments that show how QBER scales with interception probability. `BB84Service` gains `eveInterceptionRate` and `channelNoise` parameters; `runFullProtocol` and `createInitialState` updated accordingly.

- **QKD deployment explorer — 2 new US deployments** (`/learn`): Added AWS Center for Quantum Networking (CQN) — Amazon's research initiative focused on quantum memory, repeaters, and scalable networking toward a global quantum internet — and the Chicago Quantum Exchange (CQE) 111 km fiber network connecting UChicago, Argonne National Laboratory, and Toshiba, demonstrating multi-node entanglement distribution.

- **Entropy & Randomness module — FIPS 203/204 seed requirements** (`/learn`): New callout section documents that ML-KEM (FIPS 203) requires exactly 32 bytes of full entropy for `d` and `z` seeds, ML-DSA (FIPS 204) requires 32 bytes for `ρ`, `ρ'`, and `K` seeds, and that per SP 800-131A Rev 3 the RBG security strength must match the target PQC security category (e.g., 256-bit RBG for ML-KEM-1024 Category 5). Also added LMS/XMSS stateful signature entropy failure note and XOF_DRBG (SHAKE-based, SP 800-90A Rev 2) to the DRBG mechanism comparison.

- **Standards Library — 4 new records** (`/library`): RFC 9258 (TLS 1.3 external PSK importer for QKD key injection), NIST SP 800-108 Rev 1 (KDF using PRFs — counter, feedback, and double-pipeline modes; PKCS#11 `CKM_SP800_108_COUNTER_KDF`), NIST SP 800-56C Rev 2 (key derivation for key-establishment including hybrid QKD+PQC EtE), and PKCS#11 v3.0 OASIS Standard (`CKM_HKDF_DERIVE`, `CKM_SP800_108_COUNTER_KDF`, `CKM_HKDF_KEY_GEN`). All tagged with `qkd`, `key-management`, `hybrid-crypto`, or `tls-basics` cross-references.

- **ScoreCard — scoring transparency modal** (`/`): An info button (ⓘ) on the Learning Journey ScoreCard opens a `ScoringModal` explaining the four weighted dimensions: Knowledge (40%), Breadth (30%), Practice (20%), and Time & Consistency (10%), with belt thresholds displayed for each rank.

### Fixed

- **Security — Assessment URL parameter injection** (`/assess`): URL-hydrated state (industry, country, algorithms, compliance frameworks, use cases, infrastructure) is now validated against allowlists derived from the canonical `assessmentData` constants and `REGION_COUNTRIES_MAP`. Arbitrary values injected via shared assessment URLs are silently discarded rather than written to the store.

- **Security — XSS-safe global error overlay** (`src/main.tsx`): Replaced `innerHTML`-based error display with safe DOM construction (`textContent` / `createElement`). Handler is now gated behind `import.meta.env.DEV` so it is completely absent from production bundles.

- **Security — OpenSSL worker eval() removal** (`/openssl`): The `fetch()+eval()` fallback path in the WASM script loader has been replaced with a hard fail and descriptive error message. The worker is a Classic Worker and must use `importScripts`; silent eval was a supply-chain risk and is now gone.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Learning Module** (`/learn`): New module with three workshop
  parts — (1) Interactive BB84 protocol simulator with configurable qubit count (8/16/32) and
  toggleable Eve eavesdropper for eavesdropping detection demos, (2) Post-processing visualization
  covering error correction, privacy amplification, and hybrid key derivation, and (3) Global QKD
  deployment explorer with real-world adoption data. Includes Learn, Workshop, Exercises, and
  References tabs. Fully integrated with InlineTooltip glossary, time-spent tracking, and the
  Learning Journey scorecard.

- **Compliance Landscape Dashboard** (`/compliance`): New interactive compliance visualization
  with a 2024–2036 deadline timeline (urgency-coded: imminent/near-term/future), framework cards
  showing PQC requirements, region/industry chips, and cross-references to Library and Timeline.
  Persona integration pre-selects relevant region/industry filters. Includes summary stats (total
  frameworks, PQC-required count, deadline count) and expandable framework detail with related
  documents.

- **Four new UI components** (`src/components/ui/`): `<Skeleton>` (pulse loading placeholder),
  `<EmptyState>` (icon/title/description/action), `<ErrorAlert>` (retry-capable error display),
  and `<CategoryBadge>` (region/industry/level semantic badge). All use semantic tokens only and
  fulfill missing component entries from `docs/ux-standard.md`.

- **Assessment wizard modularized**: The 13-step risk assessment wizard is now split into
  dedicated step components (`src/components/Assess/steps/`) — one file per step — improving
  maintainability and enabling independent testing. Steps include multi-select fields for data
  sensitivity, retention, and credential lifetime with consistent "Unknown" escape-hatch buttons.

- **Assessment data layer extracted**: Scoring logic, type definitions (`AssessmentInput`,
  `HNDLRiskWindow`, `HNFLRiskWindow`), and algorithm database extracted into
  `src/hooks/assessmentData.ts`, `assessmentTypes.ts`, and `assessmentUtils.ts` for cleaner
  separation of concerns and reuse across wizard steps.

- **UX design system documentation** (`docs/`): Added `ux-standard.md` (full semantic token
  standard, component contracts, page header conventions) and `ux-gap-analysis.md` (current
  violations inventory and remediation backlog).

- **Compliance CSV** (`src/data/compliance_02222026.csv`): New date-stamped compliance framework
  dataset with framework metadata, deadlines, regions, industries, PQC requirements, and
  cross-references. Auto-discovered by `complianceData.ts` via `import.meta.glob`.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Persona-filtered quiz** (`/learn/quiz`): Quiz questions now carry a `personas` tag (CSV column).
  When a learning persona is active, the quiz module filters questions and dynamically recomputes
  category metadata (question counts, available categories) so each persona sees only relevant
  content. Quick, Full, and Category modes all respect the active persona filter.

- **Glossary expansion** (`/learn`): Added 24 new glossary terms covering TLS (cipher suites,
  handshake), VPN/SSH (Rosenpass, sntrup761), email signing (SignedData, EnvelopedData,
  KEMRecipientInfo), key management (PKCS#11, key lifecycle), stateful signatures (Merkle tree,
  Winternitz OTS), digital assets (P2PKH, BIP44), 5G security (ECIES, AUSF, SIDF, UDM), and
  digital identity (PID, Relying Party, Wallet Instance Attestation). Enriched ~40 existing terms
  with `relatedModule` deep links to learning modules.

- **Glossary button in Learn header** (`/learn`): Added the `GlossaryButton` component to the
  `PKILearningView` header bar, accessible from both the dashboard and individual module views.

## [1.21.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Simulated Hybrid KEM in Hybrid Crypto Workshop** (`/learn`): X25519MLKEM768 is not available as
  a standalone `genpkey` algorithm in the OpenSSL WASM build. The workshop now simulates hybrid KEM
  by running X25519 ECDH (Web Crypto API) and ML-KEM-768 (OpenSSL WASM) as separate operations, then
  combining shared secrets via HKDF-Extract (SHA-256). The KEM demo shows side-by-side cards for pure
  PQC (ML-KEM-768) and hybrid (X25519 + ML-KEM-768) with component secret breakdown (PQC secret,
  classical secret, combined HKDF secret) and per-phase timing. Key generation step produces separate
  X25519 and ML-KEM-768 keys with combined PEM output.

### Fixed

- **Hybrid Crypto WASM file persistence** (`/learn`): All HybridCryptoService methods now correctly
  pass file data between OpenSSL WASM calls. Previously, key files, ciphertext, and signatures were
  lost between `openSSLService.execute()` invocations because each call creates a fresh WASM
  instance. Fixes ML-DSA-65 certificate generation ("No such file or directory") and KEM
  encapsulation/decapsulation failures.

- **Complete Module button visibility** (`/learn`): The "Complete Module" button now correctly
  appears on the last step of all learning modules including Quantum Threats and Hybrid Crypto.
  Previously the button was hidden on the final step due to an off-by-one check.

- **Composite certificate generation** (`/learn`): Fixed CompositeCertificateViewer to pass key file
  data when generating self-signed certificates, resolving "Could not open file" errors for both
  ECDSA P-256 and ML-DSA-65 certificates.

- **Library detail modal on mobile** (`/library`): Made the document detail modal responsive on
  mobile devices with proper layout and scrolling.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **7-layer Enterprise Infrastructure Stack**: Restructured the Migrate module from 5 layers to 7
  distinct architectural tiers — Cloud, Network, Application Servers & Software, Database, Security
  Stack, Operating System, Hardware & Secure Elements. Each layer has a dedicated icon, color
  scheme, and descriptive subtitle. Products can now span multiple layers via comma-separated values
  (e.g., AWS KMS appears under both Cloud and Security Stack), with the filter, table icon, and
  layer label column all supporting multi-layer display.

- **Security Stack layer with 42 products**: New dedicated layer for security-critical
  infrastructure covering KMS, PKI, Crypto Libraries, Certificate Lifecycle Management, Secrets
  Management, IAM, Data Protection, and CIAM. Includes Venafi, Keyfactor, HashiCorp Vault, Okta,
  Keycloak, Auth0, ForgeRock, DigiCert, Sectigo, Thales CipherTrust DSP, IBM Guardium, Virtru,
  and core cryptographic libraries (OpenSSL, Bouncy Castle, liboqs, wolfSSL, Google Tink, AWS-LC).

- **30+ new product entries across 10 categories**: Cloud KMS (AWS, Google, Azure), Cloud HSM
  (Thales Luna, AWS CloudHSM, Azure Dedicated HSM), QRNG (ID Quantique Quantis, Quantinuum Quantum
  Origin, QuintessenceLabs), QKD (ID Quantique Cerberis, Toshiba QKD, Quantum Bridge), Network
  Encryptors (Thales HSE, Senetas CN7000, Adva FSP 3000, Ciena WaveLogic 6), Confidential
  Computing (Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, ARM CCA), IAM (Okta, Keycloak, Ping Identity), CIAM (Auth0,
  ForgeRock), Data Protection (Thales CipherTrust DSP, IBM Guardium, Virtru), and Certificate
  Lifecycle Management (DigiCert, Sectigo, EJBCA).

- **PQC Support filter**: Replaced the Platform dropdown with a PQC Support filter that normalizes
  the detailed capability strings into four broad groups — Yes, Limited, Planned, No — so users can
  instantly find products with production-ready quantum-safe capabilities versus those still on the
  roadmap.

- **Contextual filter cascading**: Category and PQC Support dropdowns now derive their available
  options from the currently filtered dataset. Selecting a layer automatically reduces the Category
  dropdown to only categories present in that layer, and vice versa. Stale selections auto-reset to
  "All" when they become unavailable.

### Changed

- **Reference Catalog renamed**: "Software Reference Catalog" heading renamed to "Reference
  Catalog", "Software" column renamed to "Product", "View Related Software" button renamed to "View
  Related Products", and "Software Coverage Gaps" renamed to "Coverage Gaps" throughout the Migrate
  module.

- **193 total products** (up from 161), with multi-layer overlap bringing effective per-layer
  counts to: Cloud 24, Network 13, Application 86, Database 6, Security Stack 42, OS 7,
  Hardware 27.

### Fixed

- **CSV data quality audit**: Consolidated redundant PKI category (CSC-020 merged into CSC-004),
  removed duplicate HashiCorp Vault row, corrected Palo Alto PAN-OS layer assignment from OS to
  Network to match its NGFW peer group.

- **Thales Luna Cloud HSM accuracy**: Corrected PQC support from "Yes (ML-KEM ML-DSA FIPS 140-3
  L3)" to "No (PQC roadmap pending)" and FIPS validation from "FIPS 140-3 L3" to "FIPS 140-2 L3"
  based on current product capabilities.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **HNFL concept in PQC 101**: The introductory module now covers both harvest-now attack models
  side-by-side. A new "Key concept: HNFL" panel in Step 1 explains that "Harvest Now, Forge Later"
  targets **authenticity and integrity** — adversaries capture signed artifacts (firmware images,
  certificate chains, code-signing blobs) today and retroactively forge or repudiate those
  signatures once a CRQC exists. This contrasts with HNDL (which targets confidentiality). The
  "Digital signatures & code signing" risk bullet now surfaces the HNFL label as a forward
  reference, and Exercise 2 has been reframed to ask learners to distinguish both threat models and
  the algorithm families (ML-DSA/SLH-DSA for HNFL, ML-KEM for HNDL) that address each.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Expanded quantum threat dataset (80 threats, 20 industries)**: The Quantum Threats module now
  draws from an updated dataset covering Aerospace/Aviation, Automotive/Connected Vehicles, Cloud
  Computing, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain, Energy/Critical Infrastructure, Financial Services,
  Government/Defense, Healthcare, Insurance, IoT, IT/Software, Legal/eSignature, Media/DRM,
  Payment Card Industry, Rail/Transit, Retail/E-Commerce, Supply Chain/Logistics,
  Telecommunications, and Water/Wastewater — each with criticality rating, vulnerable algorithms,
  PQC replacement recommendation, and primary source citations.
- **Expanded global PQC timeline**: Timeline updated with new milestones through February 2026
  including DoD/SandboxAQ AQtive Guard deployment (Pentagon 5-year contract), Ethereum Foundation
  PQC security initiative ($2M research prize pool, Jan 2026), CISA federal PQC procurement
  guidance (Jan 2026, pursuant to EO 14306), G7 financial sector PQC roadmap (Jan 2026,
  U.S. Treasury + Bank of England), National Quantum Initiative reauthorization (Jan 2026),
  Samsung/Thales ML-KEM embedded secure element (Jan 2026), Australia ASD migration deadlines
  (2026–2030), Canada departmental planning deadlines (2026–2031), China NGCC program and
  financial sector milestones (2025–2030), EU coordinated PQC roadmap milestones (2026–2035),
  France ANSSI first PQC certifications (Sept–Oct 2025), and Germany BSI quantum-secure
  demonstrator (Nov 2025).

### Changed

- **Transformation Leaders updated to 100 verified profiles**: Dataset refreshed with corrections
  and new additions including Philip Intallura (HSBC Group Head Quantum Technologies), Dr. Krysta
  Svore (NVIDIA, former Microsoft Azure Quantum VP), Niccolò De Masi (IonQ Chairman & CEO),
  Bruno Couillard (Crypto4A, pioneer of crypto-agile HSMs), Denis Mandich (Qrypt, 20 years US
  Intelligence Community), Éric Brier (Thales, FALCON algorithm co-designer), Dr. Bob Sutor
  (Sutor Group, former IBM VP Quantum, 40+ years at IBM), Prof. Bill Buchanan OBE (Edinburgh
  Napier, Stanford top 2% scientists 2025), Dr. Colin Soutar (Deloitte Global Quantum Cyber
  Readiness Lead), Konstantinos Karagiannis (Protiviti Director Quantum Computing Services),
  Sheetal Mehta (NTT DATA SVP Global Head of Cybersecurity), and Tom Patterson (Accenture
  Managing Director Emerging Technology Security).
- **Software reference corrected — Google Cloud HSM now shows PQC support**: Google Cloud HSM
  entry updated to reflect that PQC key types (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, X-Wing) are available
  through Cloud KMS with HSM protection level. Previous entry incorrectly listed PQC as
  unavailable.

## [1.18.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Consistent "I don't know" UX across all wizard steps**: Steps 6 (Migration Status), 11 (Crypto
  Agility), and 14 (Timeline Pressure) now use the same dashed-border escape-hatch button pattern
  as Step 3. Previously these three steps embedded "Don't Know" as a regular radio option
  indistinguishable from substantive answers.
- **Consolidated HNDL / HNFL Risk Windows section in report**: The two separate risk window panels
  are now unified into a single "Harvest-Now Attack Risk Windows" section with a **Key Milestones**
  table at the top (Today, Estimated CRQC, Data/Credential expiry dates with at-risk / safe badges)
  followed by the individual timeline visualizations.
- **HNDL / HNFL risk windows for "I don't know" users**: When users select "I don't know" on the
  Data Retention or Credential Lifetime steps, the report now shows risk window visualizations using
  conservative defaults (15-year retention, 10-year credential lifetime) with "(estimated)" labels
  and guidance to define policies for a precise assessment. Previously these sections were invisible
  when the user didn't know their values.

### Changed

- **"I don't know" scoring treats unknowns as high risk**: All "don't know" inputs are now scored
  conservatively rather than as low/moderate risk:
  - Crypto agility unknown: 0.7 &rarr; 0.9 (same as hardcoded)
  - Timeline pressure unknown: 1.1&times; &rarr; 1.2&times; (near-term pressure assumed)
  - Sensitivity unknown: treated as "high" (was implicitly "low")
  - Retention unknown: 12pts retention score (was 0)
  - Infrastructure unknown: 15pts complexity (was 10)
  - Vendor dependency unknown: treated as heavy-vendor (was mixed)

## [1.18.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **"I don't know" escape hatches in Risk Assessment wizard**: Six wizard steps now include explicit
  uncertainty options, ensuring users who lack complete information can still complete the assessment:
  - **Step 3 (Current Crypto)**: "I don't know / Not sure" chip clears algorithm selections and
    triggers conservative RSA-2048 + ECDH equivalent scoring in the engine; all algorithm chips dim
    while active. Wizard cannot advance without at least one algorithm selected _or_ the unknown flag set.
  - **Step 5 (Compliance)**: "None apply / I don't know" button clears all selected frameworks
    (optional step — no blocking).
  - **Step 7 (Use Cases)**: Styled "I don't know / None of these" button replaces the old plain text
    skip hint (optional step — no blocking).
  - **Step 8 (Data Retention)**: "I don't know / Not sure" chip clears retention selections;
    engine falls back to sensitivity-based HNDL estimate. Wizard requires at least one selection
    _or_ the unknown flag before advancing.
  - **Step 11 (Infrastructure)**: Styled "None of these / I don't know" button (optional step —
    no blocking).
  - **Step 12 (Vendors)**: "I don't know / Not sure" button clears vendor selection and defaults
    engine to `mixed` dependency weighting. Wizard requires a selection _or_ the unknown flag.
- **Compliance framework descriptions in Step 5**: Each compliance framework button now shows
  a description sub-line — industry-specific frameworks use their config description; universal
  frameworks (NIST, NIS2, etc.) show the deadline and first sentence of regulatory notes.
- **Awareness-gap remediation actions**: When a user answers "I don't know" on any wizard step,
  the assessment report automatically surfaces targeted recommended actions at the top of the
  priority list to help close those knowledge gaps — e.g. "Conduct a cryptographic asset inventory"
  for unknown algorithms, "Establish a data retention policy" for unknown retention, etc. Covers
  unknown crypto, unknown retention, unknown vendors, missing compliance selections, missing use
  cases, and missing infrastructure data.
- **Quick Assessment executive summary**: Quick assessments (steps 1–6 only) now produce a
  concise executive summary paragraph in the report, summarising risk level, vulnerable algorithms,
  compliance pressure, and migration status. Previously only comprehensive assessments had this.
- **Quick/Comprehensive badge in report header**: A small pill badge in the report header identifies
  whether the result came from a Quick or Comprehensive assessment.
- **HNDL warning banner for quick assessments**: When a quick assessment is completed with
  `high` or `critical` data sensitivity, a warning banner appears in the report noting that
  Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later risk was not quantified (data retention was not collected) and
  recommending a comprehensive assessment.
- **Country-aware regulatory pressure scoring**: The compound engine now incorporates a
  `COUNTRY_REGULATORY_URGENCY` map (14 jurisdictions) so selecting a country with active
  PQC mandates (e.g. United States, France) increases the Regulatory Pressure category score.
  The legacy quick path also receives a country boost proportional to the urgency weight.
- **`requiresPQC: null` third state for unrecognised compliance frameworks**: Compliance
  frameworks not in the database now surface as "Status unknown" (grey badge) rather than
  "No PQC mandate yet" (which was misleading). The report's compliance impact panel handles
  all three states: `true` (PQC Required / amber), `null` (Status unknown / grey),
  `false` (No PQC mandate yet / grey).

### Changed

- **Risk thresholds recalibrated**: Low/Medium/High/Critical boundaries moved from 30/60/80 to
  25/55/75. This better reflects the distribution of real scores — fewer organisations
  incorrectly land in "Low" and the "Critical" band triggers sooner for high-exposure profiles.
- **NIS2 deadline text updated**: The NIS2 Directive entry now reads
  "October 2024 (transposition passed — enforcement underway)" to reflect that the transposition
  deadline has passed and enforcement is active across the EU.
- **Assessment stale threshold extended**: In-progress (incomplete) wizard sessions are now
  preserved for 30 days before being auto-reset (previously 7 days), reducing accidental
  loss of partially-completed assessments.

## [1.17.5] - 2026-02-21

### Changed

- **Dependency upgrades**: Merged 4 Dependabot updates — `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.0.18,
  `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` 0.5.0, `jsdom` 28.1.0, `eslint-plugin-security` 4.0.0.
- **ESLint config for security plugin v4**: Adapted flat config to manually extract plugins and
  rules from `security.configs.recommended` to avoid circular reference crash in `defineConfig()`.
- **Updated SBOM**: Refreshed 9 dependency versions in About page to match actual installed
  (React 19.2.4, Framer Motion 12.34.2, Tailwind CSS 4.2.0, tailwind-merge 3.5.0,
  React Router 7.13.0, Zustand 5.0.11, Prettier 3.8.1, Vitest 4.0.18, Playwright 1.58.2).
- **Security audit date**: Bumped to February 21, 2026 (same findings — 13 dev-only, 0 production).

### Fixed

- **Persona "For you" badge**: `setPersona` no longer resets `suppressSuggestion` to false,
  preventing the assessment-inferred badge from reappearing after selecting then clearing a role.

## [1.17.4] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Persona-aware guided tour**: The first-visit onboarding tour now filters steps to only highlight
  features visible in the active persona's navigation — an Executive won't be shown the Playground
  or OpenSSL Studio steps.
- **Persona-aware hero CTAs**: Landing page primary and secondary call-to-action buttons now adapt
  to the selected role — Executives are directed to Risk Assessment, Developers to the Playground,
  Architects to the Migration Timeline, and Researchers to Algorithm Explorer.
- **"For you" persona badge on landing**: After completing the Risk Assessment, the inferred
  recommended persona is surfaced with a "For you" badge on the home page role picker.
- **Cross-view CTAs**: Assessment report now includes a "Start Learning" link to the persona-matched
  learning path; the learning path panel includes a "Start Assessment" CTA when no assessment has
  been completed.
- **Compliance and Migrate in executive nav**: `/compliance` and `/migrate` added to the Executive
  persona's navigation — assessment report links to both views are no longer dead ends.
- **Assess in developer nav**: `/assess` added to the Developer persona's navigation — the
  algorithm migration matrix in the report is now reachable.
- **Playground in architect nav**: `/playground` added to the Security Architect persona's
  navigation for hands-on PoC algorithm evaluation.

### Changed

- **Persona inference rewritten**: `inferPersonaFromAssessment()` now correctly maps assessment
  answers to all four persona types. Previous implementation used wrong enum values and always
  defaulted to Architect; Researcher was never reachable. Now uses correct field values
  (`not-started`/`started`/`planning`, `fully-abstracted`, etc.) and returns `null` when signal is
  insufficient.
- **Default persona is now null**: First-time visitors see the full navigation (same as Researcher)
  rather than being silently assigned Researcher. "Clear all" in the persona picker now fully resets
  to no selection.
- **Developer learning path expanded**: Added Quantum Threats module (after PQC 101) and Crypto
  Agility module (after Hybrid Crypto). Path now includes a 4th checkpoint and grows from 405 to
  495 estimated minutes.
- **Architect learning path expanded**: Added TLS Basics module (after Hybrid Crypto). Estimated
  time grows from 420 to 465 minutes.
- **Executive quiz categories fixed**: Removed `industry-threats` from quiz pre-selection — the
  corresponding module was never taught in the executive path. Replaced with `crypto-agility` which
  is covered by the Crypto Agility module.
- **Persona order unified**: Role buttons across home page and learn page now follow the same
  order: Executive → Developer → Architect → Researcher.
- **Assessment report link filtering**: "Explore" action links in the assessment report are now
  hidden when they point to a route outside the active persona's navigation — no more dead links.
- **Researcher learning path**: Added 5th checkpoint after the three application modules (Digital
  Assets, 5G Security, Digital ID) for consistent knowledge verification before the final quiz.

## [1.17.3] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

- **Single-select industry**: The industry picker on the home page now works as single-select —
  clicking an industry selects it exclusively; clicking the active industry deselects it (returns
  to All Industries). Previously allowed multi-select.
- **Timeline country dropdown scoped to region**: When a region is selected on the home page,
  the Timeline country filter shows only that region's group and its individual countries
  (Americas → US + Canada, Europe → 8 EU countries, APAC → 8 APAC countries; Global/none shows all).
- **Digital ID learning module**: Finance & Banking added as a relevant industry alongside
  Government & Defense and Healthcare.

## [1.17.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Library industry filter**: Normalized 40+ raw CSV industry aliases (e.g. `Finance`, `Gov`,
  `Telecom`, `Critical Infrastructure`) to the 11 canonical industry names used across the app.
  The industry dropdown now shows clean canonical names instead of 30+ fragmented raw tags.
- **Library persona → filter**: Selecting an industry on the home page now correctly pre-filters
  the Library (was returning 0 results due to vocabulary mismatch between canonical names and CSV tags).
- **Library untagged items**: Documents with no specific industry tag (broadly applicable standards)
  now appear in all industry-filtered views instead of being hidden.

### Changed

- **Assessment country step**: Step 2 (Country) now lists only the countries that belong to the
  region selected on the home page (Americas → US + Canada, Europe → 8 EU countries,
  APAC → 8 APAC countries, Global/none → all countries).
- **Assessment pre-seeding**: Industry and country fields are now seeded from the home page
  persona selection when starting a fresh assessment (no URL params, no in-progress assessment).

## [1.17.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Mobile Compliance View** (`/compliance`): New dedicated mobile layout with card-based display
  for compliance records, optimized for touch navigation and small screens.
- **Mobile Threats List** (`/threats`): New dedicated mobile layout for the threats dashboard,
  presenting threat cards in a vertically stacked, touch-friendly format.

### Changed

- **Compliance Table tooltips**: PQC mechanism and classical algorithm tooltips now support
  tap-to-toggle on mobile in addition to hover on desktop, replacing the hover-only interaction.
- **Tooltip viewport clamping**: Tooltip width constrained to `min(256px, 100vw-32px)` to prevent
  overflow on small screens.
- **Gantt Detail Popover**: Refactored layout for improved readability and usability on mobile.
- **Filter Dropdown**: Adjusted touch targets for better mobile usability.
- **Personalization Section**: Minor layout refinements for small-screen display.
- **Main Layout**: Navigation adjustments for mobile responsiveness.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Personalization Panel** (`/`): New three-dimension picker on the home page lets users set their
  role (Executive, Developer, Architect, Researcher), region (Americas, Europe, APAC, Global),
  and industry (11 sectors) in a single always-editable section below the hero stats bar.
  Selections persist across sessions via localStorage.
- **Persona-driven navigation**: Selecting a role hides irrelevant pages from the nav;
  always-visible pages (Home, Learn, Timeline, Threats, About) remain accessible to all users
  regardless of persona.
- **"For you" card badges**: Landing page feature cards show a "For you" badge for the top 3
  pages most relevant to the active persona.
- **Region pre-seeding**: Selecting a region pre-filters the Timeline on mount and pre-seeds the
  Assessment country field (Americas → United States, Europe → France, APAC → Japan).
- **Industry pre-seeding**: Selecting an industry pre-seeds the Assessment industry field,
  pre-filters the Threats dashboard, adds an industry filter chip row to the Library, and
  highlights relevant Learning modules with a "Relevant" badge.
- **Industry icons**: Each industry chip in the personalization panel now displays a contextual
  icon (e.g. `Landmark` for Finance, `Shield` for Government, `HeartPulse` for Healthcare).
- **"All Industries" chip**: Explicit chip in the industry row to reset to no filter, always
  highlighted when no industry is selected.

### Changed

- **Learn module**: Removed the in-Learn persona picker; learning paths are now driven entirely
  by the home page persona selection. When no persona is set, the full module grid is shown with
  a "Personalize from home" button linking back to the home page.

## [1.16.1] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Executive Summary Dashboard** (`/executive`): High-level PQC readiness metrics, organizational risk scores, and priority action items.
- **7 New PKI Learning Modules** (`/learn`): Added new comprehensive interactive courses:
  - Quantum Threats (HNDL Timeline, Algorithm Vulnerability)
  - Hybrid Cryptography (Key Generation, Signatures)
  - Crypto Agility & Architecture (Abstraction, CBOM)
  - Stateful Hash Signatures (LMS, XMSS)
  - Email & Document Signing (S/MIME, CMS)
  - VPN/IPsec & SSH
  - Key Management & HSM

### Fixed

- **Time Tracking Analytics** (`/learn`): Replaced erroneous `Date.now()` logic that was previously causing massive `timeSpent` metric inflation. Restored sub-minute `float` state precision to correctly accumulate elapsed time across all 14 learning modules, and applied a clean decimal-mask (`Math.floor()`) during frontend Dashboard render.
- **KeyRotationPlanner Build**: Fixed a strict TS compilation error regarding target algorithms missing data keys.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

#### Learning Platform Restructure

- **Learning Platform Restructure** (`/learn`): PKI Workshop, Digital Assets, and 5G Security
  modules restructured to the 3-tab layout (Learn | Simulate | Exercises) established by TLS
  Basics. Each module now separates educational theory from hands-on practice and includes guided
  exercise scenarios with "Load & Run" presets and a Quiz CTA.
- **PKI Workshop** (`/learn/pki-workshop`): New Learn tab with 6 educational sections (What is
  PKI, Certificate Lifecycle with interactive diagram, X.509 Anatomy, Trust Chains & Validation,
  PQC in PKI, CTA). New Exercises tab with 5 guided scenarios (RSA-2048, ECDSA P-256, ML-DSA-44,
  ML-DSA-87, SLH-DSA) that pre-configure the workshop and navigate to the correct step.
- **Digital Assets** (`/learn/digital-assets`): New Learn tab with blockchain cryptography
  introduction covering key generation, address derivation, digital signing, and PQC threat
  analysis per chain. New Exercises tab with guided scenarios for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and
  HD Wallet flows.
- **5G Security** (`/learn/5g-security`): New Learn tab with 6 sections — What is 5G Security
  (3GPP TS 33.501 overview, IMSI catcher history), The Three Pillars (Privacy/Authentication/
  Provisioning), SUCI Protection Schemes (Profile A/B/C comparison), 5G-AKA Authentication
  (MILENAGE f1-f5, key hierarchy), SIM Provisioning & Supply Chain, Post-Quantum Threat to 5G
  (quantum-vulnerable vs quantum-resistant components). New Exercises tab with 5 scenarios
  (Profile A Classical, Profile B NIST, Profile C Hybrid, Profile C Pure PQC, 5G-AKA
  Authentication).

#### Data Expansion

- **Leaders Board Expanded**: 12 new PQC leaders added via `leaders_02202026.csv` — Prof Bill Buchanan OBE (Edinburgh Napier), Dr. Bob Sutor (Sutor Group), Bruno Couillard (Crypto4A), Dr. Colin Soutar (Deloitte), Denis Mandich (Qrypt), Éric Brier (Thales), Konstantinos Karagiannis (Protiviti), Dr. Krysta Svore (Microsoft Azure Quantum), Niccolò De Masi (IonQ), Philip Intallura (HSBC), Sheetal Mehta (NTT DATA), Tom Patterson (Accenture); total now 98 leaders

### Changed

- **Dashboard Progress** (`/learn`): Module progress calculation now uses accurate per-module step
  counts via a `MODULE_STEP_COUNTS` map instead of a hardcoded default of 4 steps. PKI Workshop
  description and duration updated (45 min → 60 min).

### Fixed

- **Algorithm Data**: 10 factual inaccuracies corrected across PQC algorithm profiles
- **Migration Guide**: 5 factual inaccuracies corrected in migration planning content

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Quiz CSV Data Layer** (`/learn/quiz`): Extracted all quiz questions from hardcoded TypeScript
  into a date-stamped CSV file (`pqcquiz_02192026.csv`), following the established pattern used
  by Leaders, Timeline, Threats, and Library modules. The quiz software auto-selects the most
  recent CSV via `import.meta.glob` in the new `quizDataLoader.ts` loader.
- **Quiz Mode Column** (`/learn/quiz`): New `quiz_mode` field on every question (`quick`, `full`,
  `both`) enables pool-based filtering — Quick Quiz draws from the `quick`+`both` pool (~121
  questions), Full Assessment samples from all 162 questions.
- **Expanded Question Pool** (`/learn/quiz`): Grew from 80 to 162 questions across 8 categories,
  grounded in the app's authoritative data sources (algorithm reference, timeline, threats, and
  learn module content). ~20 questions per category.
- **Smart Sampling with Guaranteed Coverage** (`/learn/quiz`): Both quiz modes now guarantee
  minimum category representation — Quick Quiz: 20 questions with ≥2 per category; Full
  Assessment: 80 questions with ≥10 per category. Every run produces a unique random mix.
- **Source Attribution** (`/learn/quiz`): Quiz intro header displays the source CSV filename and
  last-updated date, consistent with other data-driven pages.

### Changed

- **Full Assessment** (`/learn/quiz`): Changed from "all questions" to an 80-question random
  sample drawn from the full 162-question pool with guaranteed category coverage.
- **Quiz Data Structure** (`/learn/quiz`): `quizData.ts` is now a thin re-export shim; all data
  loading and category metadata live in `quizDataLoader.ts`.

### Fixed

- **Quiz Question Accuracy** (`/learn/quiz`): Applied 7 factual corrections — CNSA 2.0 2030
  scope clarification, EO 14306 date/attribution, Germany's QUANTITY initiative description,
  GSMA PQ.03 v2.0 publication date, Canada CCCS 2026 milestone wording, and a self-contradictory
  TLS hybrid failure explanation.

## [1.14.4] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Inline Tooltips** (`/assess`): Jargon terms (HNDL, PQC, Crypto Agility, HSM) in the wizard
  now show click-to-open glossary definitions via a new `InlineTooltip` component backed by 180+
  glossary terms.
- **Quick Assessment Mode** (`/assess`): New mode selector on the landing page — "Quick" (6 steps,
  ~2 min) or "Comprehensive" (13 steps, ~5 min). Quick mode uses the legacy scoring path.
- **Migration Roadmap** (`/assess`): Phased visualization in the report grouping recommended actions
  into 3 swim lanes (0–6 mo, 6–18 mo, 18–36 mo) with effort badges and country deadline indicator.

### Changed

- **Context-Aware Cross-Links** (`/assess`): "Explore" links in recommended actions now carry
  user-specific query params (e.g. `/algorithms?highlight=RSA-2048,ECDH`,
  `/threats?industry=Finance`). Algorithm Transition Guide highlights matching rows; Threats
  Dashboard pre-filters by industry. Migration matrix adds "Try in Playground" links for PQC
  replacement algorithms.
- **Progress Persistence** (`/assess`): Stale assessment threshold extended from 24 hours to 7 days.
  Resume banner shows on return with step info, timestamp, and Continue / Start Over options.

## [1.14.3] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **PDF Print Cross-Browser** (`/assess`): Report PDF now renders correctly in both Chrome and
  Safari. Chrome was not repeating `html { margin-top }` on pages 2+, causing content to overlap
  the fixed header/footer. Replaced with an invisible `<table class="print-report-table">` whose
  `<thead>` (14mm) and `<tfoot>` (10mm) are treated as per-page repeating groups by both browsers.
  All CSS selectors use child combinators (`>`) to avoid cascading into inner report tables.
- **Library Markdown Parser** (`/library`): Fixed markdown rendering regression introduced by
  Prettier reformatting the parser configuration.
- **Security Dependencies** (`deps`): Added `overrides` for `minimatch` and `ajv` to resolve
  high-severity audit findings in transitive dependencies.
- **CI Security Audit** (`ci`): Scoped `npm audit` to production dependencies only, eliminating
  false positives from dev-only packages in the CI pipeline.

## [1.14.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Retention Step Industry-Awareness** (`/assess`): Step 8 (Data Retention) no longer shows
  finance/healthcare-specific language for unrelated industries. Universal time-range options are
  now sourced from the CSV (empty industries column) with purely time-based descriptions.
  Every industry now has specific regulatory retention entries:
  Automotive (telematics 1-3y, vehicle lifetime 10-15y),
  Technology (SOC 2 audit logs 3y),
  Energy & Utilities (NERC CIP-007 3y, FERC/billing 7y),
  Aerospace (FAA/DO-178C aircraft lifetime 20-40y),
  Retail & E-Commerce (PCI DSS audit logs 1y, cardholder data 2y),
  Education (FERPA/financial aid 6y, permanent transcripts).
- **PDF Export** (`/assess`): Reverted to `window.print()` from html2canvas/jsPDF for more
  reliable cross-browser output.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **PDF Content Clipping** (`/assess`): Eliminated content overlap behind the fixed print
  header/footer on pages 2+. Uses invisible `<thead>`/`<tfoot>` spacer table to reserve
  per-page space for the repeating header (14mm) and footer (10mm).
- **Print Visibility** (`GuidedTour`, `WhatsNewToast`): Hidden from print output via `print:hidden`.
- **Threat Table Print** (`/assess`): Added `print:overflow-visible` and `print:min-w-0` to
  prevent right-column clipping in the PDF.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Industry-Aware Assessment Wizard** (`/assess`): Compliance, crypto usage, use case, and
  infrastructure steps now surface industry-relevant options first based on CSV-driven config
  (`pqcassessment_02192026.csv`). Industry-specific threats appendix included in report.
- **Country Compliance Filtering** (`/assess`): Step 5 (Compliance) filters frameworks by the
  selected country/jurisdiction — only globally-applicable and country-relevant frameworks are shown.
- **PDF Print Support** (`/assess`): Full print-optimized report with repeating header
  (app version, industry, country, date) and footer (assess URL, page number). Includes
  `break-inside: avoid` on sections, light-mode forced variables, `print-color-adjust: exact`
  for background colors, and framer-motion suppression.
- **Report Collapsible Sections** (`/assess`): Country PQC Migration Timeline and Industry Threat
  Landscape are collapsible on screen but always expanded in print via `hidden print:block` pattern.
- **Organization Filter** (`/library`): Replaced the Region dropdown with an Organization filter
  (NIST, IETF, ETSI, ISO, BSI, ANSSI, etc.) using a canonical org map that rolls up sub-groups.

### Fixed

- **Share URL Arrays** (`/assess`): `dataSensitivity` and `dataRetention` now correctly encode as
  comma-joined arrays in the share URL; added `cy` (country) parameter.
- **PDF Dark Mode** (`/assess`): Print CSS forces all semantic color variables to light-mode values,
  preventing invisible text on white paper when dark theme is active.
- **PDF Background Colors** (`/assess`): Added `print-color-adjust: exact` so bar graphs, badges,
  and colored elements render in the PDF instead of being stripped by the browser.
- **PDF Page Breaks** (`/assess`): `glass-panel` sections avoid splitting across pages; Threat
  Landscape starts on a fresh page; trailing blank page eliminated via `min-height: 0`.
- **Timeline Label Clipping** (`/assess`): Edge year labels (2024, 2035) use left/right-aligned
  transforms instead of centered, preventing clipping in the report timeline strip.

### Changed

- **Mobile Walkthrough** (`GuidedTour`): Redesigned the guided tour on mobile as a full-screen
  swipeable card carousel with step icons, dot indicators, and drag gestures. Desktop anchored
  tooltips unchanged. Added `?tour` query param to reset and replay the tour.
- **WhatsNew Toast** (`WhatsNewToast`): Centered on mobile (was fixed bottom-right, overflowed on
  narrow screens). Added `?whatsnew` query param for easy testing.
- **Assessment Report** (`/assess`): "Explore" links and action buttons hidden in print. Cross-industry
  threats section removed from report — only industry-specific threats shown.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Risk Assessment Country Picker** (`/assess`): New "Country" step (step 2 of 13) lets
  organizations select their jurisdiction; the selection aligns the Timeline step with real
  regulatory deadlines sourced directly from the PQC Gantt timeline data.
- **Multi-select Data Sensitivity** (`/assess`): Organizations can now select multiple sensitivity
  levels simultaneously (Low / Medium / High / Critical). Risk scoring uses the highest selected
  level; useful for organizations managing data of mixed sensitivity.
- **Multi-select Data Retention** (`/assess`): Multiple retention periods can be selected at once.
  HNDL risk is computed against the longest selected period for accurate worst-case assessment.
- **Country-aligned Migration Deadlines** (`/assess`): The Timeline step surfaces Deadline phases
  from the selected country's Gantt timeline (real years, titles, descriptions) instead of generic
  static options. Falls back gracefully when no country-specific deadlines exist.
- **Wizard Reset Button** (`/assess`): A "Reset" button in the wizard navigation footer clears all
  answers and returns to step 1, providing a quick path to restart without navigating away.

### Fixed

- **Assessment Store Schema Migration** (`/assess`): Persisted assessments from v1.12 and earlier
  stored `dataSensitivity` and `dataRetention` as strings. On rehydration these are now
  automatically upgraded to arrays, preventing a `TypeError: .filter is not a function` crash.

### Changed

- **Risk Assessment Wizard** (`/assess`): Expanded from 12 to 13 steps with the Country picker.
  `AssessmentInput.dataSensitivity` and `.dataRetention` are now `string[]`; the scoring engine
  uses `getMaxSensitivity()` and `getMaxRetentionYears()` helpers — fully backward-compatible.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Timeline Document Table** (`/timeline`): Selecting a country from the Country filter now
  reveals a document table below the Gantt chart listing all matching phases and milestones
  with organization, phase badge, type, title, period (year range), description, and source link.

### Fixed

- **Timeline Filter UX** (`/timeline`):
  - Renamed "Region" dropdown label to "Country" for clarity
  - Active filter chips with × dismiss now appear below the filter bar for every active filter
    (country, phase type, event type, and text search)
  - Result count shown alongside chips ("N results · X of Y countries")
  - Empty state with "Clear all filters" action when no results match
  - Country dropdown now renders above the sticky Gantt table headers (z-index fix)

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **PQC Quiz Module** (`/learn`): New interactive quiz in the Learning dashboard covering
  post-quantum cryptography fundamentals, algorithm families, and migration concepts.

### Fixed

- **Compliance page UI/UX** (`/compliance`):
  - Renamed ambiguous "CC" column header to "Classic" (was misread as Common Criteria)
  - Added missing BSI (DE) source card so the authoritative-sources grid is complete
  - Unified all four filter active states to `primary` color (was: accent, secondary, warning, tertiary)
  - Loading overlay now correctly reads "Refreshing Data…" during a refresh vs. "Filtering Records…" during filtering
  - Close button in detail modal replaced with `<X>` icon + `aria-label`; focus moves into modal on open
  - Filter backdrop `role="button"` replaced with `aria-hidden="true"`
  - Empty-state `colSpan` corrected from 10 to 8
  - ShareButton/GlossaryButton now visible at `md` breakpoint (was `lg`-only)

- **Guided Tour** (`/`): Fixed mobile portrait layout blocking tour from completing;
  fixed tooltip position jumping on step transitions.
