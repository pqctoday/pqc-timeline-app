Standards Track [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9810 Obsoletes: 4210 , 9480 Updates: 5912 Category: Standards Track Published: July 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: H. Brockhaus Siemens D. von Oheimb Siemens M. Ounsworth Entrust J. Gray Entrust RFC 9810 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure -- Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) Abstract This document describes the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificate Management Protocol (CMP). Protocol messages are defined for X.509v3 certificate creation and management. CMP provides interactions between client systems and PKI components such as a Registration Authority (RA) and a Certification Authority (CA). ¶ This document adds support for management of certificates containing a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) public key and uses EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue. This document also includes the updates specified in Section 2 and Appendix A.2 of RFC 9480. ¶ This document obsoletes RFC 4210, and together with RFC 9811, it also obsoletes RFC 9480. Appendix F of this document updates Section 9 of RFC 5912. ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
