# Korean Post-Quantum Cryptography Competition Final Results

## Authors

**Organization:** KISA; Ministry of Science and ICT; NIS Korea

## Scope

**Industries:** Government; Telecom; Finance; Critical Infrastructure
**Region:** South Korea; APAC
**Document type:** Algorithm

## How It Relates to PQC

Korean national PQC standards

**Dependencies:** NIST PQC; KpqC Competition

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** High

## PQC Key Types & Mechanisms

| Field                  | Value                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Algorithm family       | Lattice-based; MPC-based      |
| Security levels        | L1,L3,L5                      |
| Protocol / tool impact | Korean national PQC standards |
| Toolchain support      | Korean government systems     |

## Short Description

Korea selects HAETAE and AIMer (signatures) plus SMAUG-T and NTRU+ (KEMs) as national PQC standards. Target standardization by 2029 migration by 2035.

The following are eight Round 2 candidates. Round2 candidates Digital Signature PKE/KEM AIMer NTRU+ HAETAE PALOMA MQ-Sign REDOG NCC-Sign SMAUG+TiGER (merged) We would like to thank all the Round 1 submission teams for their efforts in this competition. They did have an impact on the maturation of the PQC fields in South Korea during Round 1. We also want to thank the public reviewers for their interests in and comments on the KpqC algorithms. Better outcomes were achieved as a result of public scrutiny and analysis. Lastly, we would like to thank all the people who assisted us and gave constructive comments to enhance the KpqC Round 1.
