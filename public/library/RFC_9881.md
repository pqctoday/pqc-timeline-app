_RFC 9881 ML-DSA in Certificates October 2025 Massimo, et al. Standards Track [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9881 Category: Standards Track Published: October 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: J. Massimo AWS P. Kampanakis AWS S. Turner sn3rd B. E. Westerbaan Cloudflare RFC 9881 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure -- Algorithm Identifiers for the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) Abstract Digital signatures are used within X.509 certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and to sign messages. This document specifies the conventions for using FIPS 204, the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) in Internet X.509 certificates and CRLs. The conventions for the associated signatures, subject public keys, and private key are also described. ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
