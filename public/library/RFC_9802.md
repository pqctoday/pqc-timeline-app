# Use of HSS and XMSS Hash-Based Signature Algorithms in X.509 PKI

## Authors

**Organization:** IETF LAMPS

## Scope

**Industries:** PKI; Gov; Critical Infrastructure
**Region:** International
**Document type:** PKI/Certificate

## How It Relates to PQC

X.509 certificates with HBS

**Dependencies:** RFC 8391; RFC 8554; SP 800-208

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** Medium

Bashiri BSI S. Fluhrer Cisco Systems S. Gazdag genua GmbH S. Kousidis BSI RFC 9802 Use of the HSS and XMSS Hash-Based Signature Algorithms in Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Abstract This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 encoding formats for the following stateful Hash-Based Signature (HBS) schemes: Hierarchical Signature System (HSS), eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), and XMSS MT (a multi-tree variant of XMSS). This specification applies to the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) when digital signatures are used to sign certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs). ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

Introduction Stateful Hash-Based Signature (HBS) schemes such as the Hierarchical Signature System (HSS), eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), and XMSS MT combine Merkle trees with One-Time Signatures (OTS). This is done in order to provide digital signature schemes that remain secure even when quantum computers become available. Their theoretic security is well understood and depends only on the security of the underlying hash function. As such, they can serve as an important building block for quantum computer resistant information and communication technology. ¶ A stateful HBS private key consists of a finite collection of OTS keys, along with state information that tracks the usage of these keys to ensure the security of the scheme. Only a limited number of messages can be signed, and the private key's state must be
