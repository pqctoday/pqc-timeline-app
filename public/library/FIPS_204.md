Raimondo, Secretary National Institute of Standards and Technology Laurie E. Locascio, NIST Director and Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology Foreword The Federal Information Processing Standards Publication Series of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is the official series of publications relating to standards and guidelines developed under 15 U.S.C. 278g-3, and issued by the Secretary of Commerce under 40 U.S.C. 11331. Comments concerning this Federal Information Processing Standard publication are welcomed and should be submitted using the contact information in the “Inquiries and comments” clause of the announcement section. Kevin M. Stine, Director Information Technology Laboratory FIPS 204 MODULE-LATTICE-BASED DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD Abstract Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. This standard specifies ML-DSA, a set of algorithms that can be used to generate and verify digital signatures. ML-DSA is believed to be secure, even against adversaries in possession of a large-scale quantum computer.
