# Terminology for Post-Quantum Traditional Hybrid Schemes

## Authors

**Organization:** IETF PQUIP

## Scope

**Industries:** IT; Standards Bodies; Protocol Developers
**Region:** International
**Document type:** Guidance

## How It Relates to PQC

Hybrid terminology standardization

**Dependencies:** N/A

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** **HIGH** — A quantum-capable adversary could forge certificates or impersonate identities protected by classical public-key cryptography. Migration to PQC-safe PKI and authentication systems is essential.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** High

RFC 9794 PQ/T Hybrid Terminology June 2025 Driscoll, et al. Informational [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9794 Category: Informational Published: June 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: F. Driscoll UK National Cyber Security Centre M. Parsons UK National Cyber Security Centre B. Hale Naval Postgraduate School RFC 9794 Terminology for Post-Quantum Traditional Hybrid Schemes Abstract One aspect of the transition to post-quantum algorithms in cryptographic protocols is the development of hybrid schemes that incorporate both post-quantum and traditional asymmetric algorithms. This document defines terminology for such schemes. It is intended to be used as a reference and, hopefully, to ensure consistency and clarity across different protocols, standards, and organisations. ¶ Status of This Memo This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

Introduction The mathematical problems of integer factorisation and discrete logarithms over finite fields or elliptic curves underpin most of the asymmetric algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures on the Internet. These problems, and hence the algorithms based on them, will be vulnerable to attacks using Shor's Algorithm on a sufficiently large general-purpose quantum computer, known as a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). Current predictions vary on when, or if, such a device will exist. However, it is necessary to anticipate and prepare to defend against such a development. Data encrypted today (in 2025) with an algorithm vulnerable to a quantum computer can be stored for decryption by a future attacker with a CRQC. Signing algorithms in products that are expected to be in use for many years, and that cannot be updated or replaced, are also at risk if a CRQC is developed during the operational lifetime of that product. ¶ Ongoing responses to the potential development of a CRQC include modifying established (or standardised) protocols to use asymmetric algorithms that are designed to be secure against quantum computers as well as today's classical computers. These algorithms are called "post-quantum", while algorithms based on integer factorisation, finite-field discrete logarithms, or elliptic-curve discrete logarithms are called "traditional cryptographic algorithms". In this document, "traditional algorithm" is also used to refer to this class of algorithms. ¶ At the time of publication, the term "post-quantum" is generally used to describe cryptographic algorithms that are designed to
