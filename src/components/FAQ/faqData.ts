        answer:
          'Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to resist attacks from both classical and quantum computers. These algorithms rely on mathematical problems — such as lattice structures, hash functions, and error-correcting codes — that remain hard even for quantum computers.

        answer:
          "RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, DSA, and Diffie-Hellman are all vulnerable to quantum attack because they rely on the hardness of integer factoring or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which Shor's algorithm solves efficiently. Symmetric algorithms like AES and hash functions like SHA-256 are weakened but not broken by Grover's algorithm.

          "Shor's algorithm can factor large integers and compute discrete logarithms in polynomial time on a quantum computer, directly breaking RSA and elliptic curve cryptography. Grover's algorithm, the best known quantum attack on symmetric ciphers, only provides a quadratic speedup — halving the effective key length — so AES-256 retains 128-bit security even against a quantum adversary.

Because 128-bit security remains computationally infeasible, AES-256 is considered quantum-safe, while AES-128 may need to be phased out for high-security applications. The Quantum Threats module visualizes these security reductions.",

          "Mosca's Theorem states that if the sum of your data's required confidentiality period and your organization's migration timeline exceeds the estimated time until a CRQC is available, then you must begin migrating now. It provides a simple inequality — shelf life + migration time > time to quantum — for deciding migration urgency. The PQC 101 module includes an interactive Mosca calculator.",

          'Active PQC research areas include tightening lattice security proofs (especially for ML-KEM and ML-DSA), developing side-channel-resistant implementations for constrained devices, exploring alternative paradigms such as multivariate, code-based, and isogeny-based cryptography, and integrating quantum random number generators (QRNG) for enhanced key generation. The Research module surveys the frontiers and open questions in post-quantum cryptography.',

          'The PQC Business Case module provides an ROI calculator that estimates the cost of delayed migration versus proactive investment, a breach cost model incorporating quantum-specific scenarios, compliance penalty exposure analysis based on your regulatory environment, and a board-ready investment memo generator. It frames PQC migration as risk mitigation with quantifiable metrics rather than a pure technology upgrade. The module produces a downloadable executive summary.',

        question: 'What is the SoftHSM WASM mode?',
        answer:
          'SoftHSM WASM mode is a browser-based PKCS#11 version 3.2 HSM emulation that runs ML-KEM and ML-DSA operations entirely in WebAssembly, featuring a dual-engine architecture with both C++ and Rust implementations for cross-check verification. You can generate PQC key pairs, perform key encapsulation/decapsulation, sign and verify messages, and inspect key attributes — all through the standard PKCS#11 API. The dual-engine cross-check confirms that both implementations produce identical results.',
