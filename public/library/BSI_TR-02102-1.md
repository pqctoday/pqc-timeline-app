# Cryptographic Mechanisms: Recommendations and Key Lengths

## Authors

**Organization:** BSI Germany

## Scope

**Industries:** Gov; Finance; Critical Infrastructure; IT
**Region:** Germany; EU
**Document type:** Compliance/Guidance

## How It Relates to PQC

German federal systems and beyond

**Dependencies:** FIPS 203/204/205

## PQC Risk Profile

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** **HIGH** — Encrypted data captured today can be decrypted by a future quantum computer (harvest-now-decrypt-later attack). Adopting this specification is critical to protect long-lived confidential data.

**Identity & Authentication Integrity:** Not directly addressed by this document.

**Digital Signature Integrity:** **HIGH** — Classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum forgery. Code signing, firmware integrity, and legally binding digital signatures depend on adopting post-quantum signature schemes.

**Migration urgency:** High
