## 8. Assess (`/assess`)

**Q1:** What are the 14 steps of the comprehensive assessment wizard?
**A1:** The 14 steps are: **Industry** → **Country** → **Crypto Stack** → **Data Sensitivity** → **Compliance** → **Migration Status** → **Use Cases** → **Data Retention** → **Credential Lifetime** → **Organization Scale** → **Crypto Agility** → **Infrastructure** → **Vendor Dependencies** → **Timeline Pressure**. Start at [Assess](/assess).

**Q2:** How does the quick assessment mode differ from comprehensive?
**A2:** **Quick mode** covers 6 steps (~2 minutes) for a rapid baseline, while **comprehensive mode** covers all 14 steps (~5 minutes) for detailed migration planning with full risk scoring. Both are available at [Assess](/assess).

**Q3:** What four risk categories does the assessment report generate?
**A3:** The report scores four categories: **Strategic Risk** (long-term quantum exposure), **Operational Risk** (system complexity and migration effort), **Compliance Risk** (regulatory deadline pressure), and **Vendor Risk** (third-party dependency control). View your results at [Report](/report).

**Q4:** How does the HNDL window calculation work?
**A4:** The HNDL window = **data retention period** minus **estimated time to CRQC**. If your data must be protected for 20 years and CRQC arrives in 10, you have a 10-year exposure window where harvested data is vulnerable. Set your retention at [Assess step 7](/assess?step=7).

**Q5:** How does country selection affect the assessment?
**A5:** Your [country selection](/assess?step=1) drives **country-aligned compliance deadlines** in the Timeline step and **filters compliance frameworks** to show only relevant regulations (e.g., selecting France shows ANSSI, selecting USA shows CNSA 2.0 and CISA).

**Q6:** What does the Data Sensitivity step assess?
**A6:** The [Data Sensitivity step](/assess?step=3) classifies your data types as **Highly Sensitive**, **Confidential**, **Internal**, or **Public** (multi-select). Scoring uses **worst-case** — if any data is Highly Sensitive, that drives the risk score.

**Q7:** How does crypto agility affect risk scoring?
**A7:** The [Crypto Agility step](/assess?step=10) rates your organization's ability to swap algorithms: "Can quickly swap" (lowest risk) to "Difficult to change" (highest risk). Low agility increases both operational and strategic risk scores.

**Q8:** What compliance frameworks are filtered by industry?
**A8:** The [Compliance step](/assess?step=4) dynamically filters frameworks based on your industry selection — e.g., Healthcare sees HIPAA and FDA 21 CFR Part 11, Finance sees PCI-DSS and DORA, Government sees FedRAMP and CNSA 2.0.

**Q9:** How does the assessment handle vendor dependency risk?
**A9:** The [Vendor Dependencies step](/assess?step=12) evaluates third-party crypto control: **Unknown** (highest risk), **Vendor-controlled**, **Hybrid**, or **Self-managed** (lowest risk). This feeds the Vendor Risk category in the report.

**Q10:** Can you resume an incomplete assessment?
**A10:** Yes, the assessment auto-saves progress at each step via localStorage. When you return to [Assess](/assess), it resumes where you left off. A Reset button with confirmation allows starting over.

**Q11:** How does the persona affect report recommendations?
**A11:** The report tailors recommendations to your persona: **Executives** see business impact, ROI, and timelines; **Developers** see implementation details; **Architects** see integration patterns; **Researchers** see academic references. Set your persona on the [Landing page](/).

**Q12:** What use cases can be selected in the assessment?
**A12:** The [Use Cases step](/assess?step=6) includes: **TLS/HTTPS**, **Code Signing**, **Email Encryption**, **VPN**, **Database Encryption**, **Digital Assets**, and more. Each selected use case maps to specific migration recommendations.

**Q13:** How does infrastructure type affect the assessment?
**A13:** The [Infrastructure step](/assess?step=11) classifies your stack as **On-premise**, **Cloud-hybrid**, or **Cloud-native**. Cloud-native environments may migrate faster (vendor-managed crypto updates), while on-premise requires more manual effort.

**Q14:** What is the purpose of the Timeline Pressure step?
**A14:** The [Timeline Pressure step](/assess?step=13) maps your organization to specific compliance deadlines (CNSA 2.0 2027–2030 prefer windows, country-specific deadlines). Higher pressure increases Compliance Risk scoring.

**Q15:** Can the assessment report be printed or saved as PDF?
**A15:** Yes, the [Report](/report) supports **Print/PDF** with a formatted header (PQC Today version, Industry, Country, DateTime) and footer. CollapsibleSections auto-expand, and action buttons are hidden for clean output.
