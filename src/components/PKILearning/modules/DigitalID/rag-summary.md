# EUDI Digital Identity Wallet Module

The EUDI Digital Identity Wallet module simulates the European Digital Identity ecosystem established by eIDAS 2.0 (Regulation EU 2024/1183), which mandates all 27 EU member states provide citizens with at least one EUDI Wallet by late 2026. Learners experience the full credential lifecycle -- issuance, presentation, and qualified electronic signing -- through a five-step interactive workshop. The module covers the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF 2.0) credential formats (mso_mdoc and SD-JWT), the layered trust framework (National Trusted Lists, QTSPs, eIDAS Bridge), privacy-by-design principles (selective disclosure, unlinkability, data minimization), and the post-quantum readiness roadmap for European digital identity.

## Key Concepts

- eIDAS 2.0 regulation: entered into force May 2024; mandatory EUDI Wallets by December 2026; private sector acceptance by late 2027; five implementing regulations adopted December 2024
- Person Identification Data (PID): the foundational credential issued by a national PID Issuer after citizen authentication, upon which all other attestations build
- Credential formats: mso_mdoc (ISO 18013-5, CBOR binary encoding, optimized for proximity via NFC/BLE) and vc+sd-jwt (SD-JWT per RFC 9901, JSON text-based, optimized for remote/online verification)
- Selective disclosure: only requested attributes are revealed to verifiers; all other claims remain cryptographically hidden, enforcing GDPR Article 5(1)(c) data minimization
- Qualified Electronic Attestations (QEAA): issued by certified QTSPs (Qualified Trust Service Providers), listed on National Trusted Lists; carry legal weight across all EU member states
- Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES): digital signatures with the legal equivalent of handwritten signatures under eIDAS 2.0; provided by QTSPs using the CSC (Cloud Signature Consortium) protocol
- Trust framework layers: National Trusted Lists (machine-readable registers of QTSPs per member state), QTSPs (issue QEAAs and provide QES), and the eIDAS Trust Framework bridge for cross-border mutual recognition
- Unlinkability: different presentations to different Relying Parties should not be correlatable; addressed through batch-issued credentials and pseudonymous identifiers
- Relying Party verification: banks, employers, and services verify credentials using selective disclosure and cryptographic proofs without contacting the issuer
- Post-quantum readiness: current implementations use ECDSA (P-256, P-384); ENISA identifies wallet providers as high-impact entities for early PQC adoption; EU PQC transition roadmap targets national roadmaps by December 2026, high-risk migration by 2030, full PQC transition by 2035; ML-DSA (FIPS 204) and SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) are expected future replacements
- Large-Scale Pilots: Wave 1 (2023-2025) includes DC4EU (education), EWC (travel), NOBID (banking/telecom), POTENTIAL (government/payments); Wave 2 (2025-2027) includes APTITUDE (travel/banking) and WE BUILD (business identity)

## Workshop Activities

- **Step 1 -- EUDI Wallet**: View the wallet holder's credentials, cryptographic keys, and activity history
- **Step 2 -- PID Issuer**: Authenticate as a citizen and receive a Person Identification Data credential (mso_mdoc format) from the national PID Issuer
- **Step 3 -- University Attestation**: Obtain a Diploma attestation (SD-JWT format) from a university, which requires a valid PID credential as a prerequisite
- **Step 4 -- Bank (Relying Party)**: Present selective identity attributes to a bank to open an account, demonstrating privacy-preserving credential verification
- **Step 5 -- QTSP (QES)**: Sign a document using a Qualified Electronic Signature via a Trust Service Provider, producing a legally binding digital signature

- OpenID4VCI (credential issuance protocol), OpenID4VP (credential presentation protocol), CSC API (Cloud Signature Consortium remote signing)
- GDPR Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization), ENISA PQC guidance for trust service providers
- FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA) as future PQC signature replacements for ECDSA in credential issuance and QES signing
