Standards Track [Page] Stream: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC: 9629 Updates: 5652 Category: Standards Track Published: August 2024 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: R. Housley Vigil Security J. Gray Entrust 大久保 智史 ( T. Okubo ) Penguin Securities Pte. Ltd. RFC 9629 Using Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) Algorithms in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Abstract The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport and key agreement algorithms. In recent years, cryptographers have been specifying Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) algorithms, including quantum-secure KEM algorithms. This document defines conventions for the use of KEM algorithms by the originator and recipients to encrypt and decrypt CMS content. This document updates RFC 5652. ¶ Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
