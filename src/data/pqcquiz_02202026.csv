HSMs ensure keys never leave the secure boundary in plaintext, providing the highest level of key protection for critical operations like CA signing, payment processing, and code signing.",/learn/key-management

FIPS 140-3 (Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules) defines security requirements for cryptographic modules including HSMs. Modules are validated at four levels (Level 1-4), with Level 3 being the most common for production HSMs. The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) administers the certification process.",/learn/key-management
km-005,key-management,multiple-choice,intermediate,both,What is PKCS#11 and why is it relevant to PQC key management?,A certificate format standard,A cryptographic token interface standard (API) that HSMs implement for key operations,A PQC algorithm specification,A network protocol for distributing encryption keys,b,"PKCS#11 (also known as Cryptoki) is the standard API for interacting with cryptographic tokens such as HSMs and smart cards. It defines operations for key generation, signing, encryption, and key management. For PQC migration, PKCS#11 must be extended to support new PQC key types (ML-KEM, ML-DSA) and their larger key sizes.",/learn/key-management
km-006,key-management,multiple-choice,intermediate,both,Why is key rotation particularly important during the PQC transition?,To reduce storage costs,To limit the exposure window if a key is compromised and to progressively transition from classical to PQC keys,To improve encryption speed,To comply with password rotation policies,b,"Key rotation during PQC transition serves two purposes: (1) it limits the exposure window for any single key (reducing HNDL risk), and (2) it provides natural migration points where classical keys can be replaced with hybrid or PQC keys without disrupting operations.",/learn/key-management
km-007,key-management,multiple-choice,intermediate,both,How do PQC key sizes compare to classical key sizes for HSM storage?,PQC keys are approximately the same size as classical keys,PQC keys are significantly larger — ML-KEM-768 public keys are ~1.2KB vs 32 bytes for X25519,PQC keys are smaller than classical keys,PQC keys cannot be stored in HSMs,b,"PQC keys are substantially larger than classical keys. ML-KEM-768 public keys are ~1,184 bytes (vs 32 for X25519), ML-DSA-65 public keys are ~1,952 bytes (vs 64 for ECDSA P-256). This impacts HSM storage capacity, PKCS#11 buffer sizes, and key distribution bandwidth. HSM capacity planning must account for these larger key sizes.",/learn/key-management
