### What This Is About

Post-quantum cryptography fundamentally alters network security operations across the entire enterprise stack. Quantum-safe certificates (like ML-DSA) are 108% larger than their classical counterparts, resulting in 5-8KB hybrid TLS certificate chains and heavier, more complex key exchanges.

### Why It Matters

Because PQC artifacts are so large, they severely stress modern firewalls and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) appliances. Older Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) with fixed-size TLS buffers often fail silently (buffer overflows) when inspecting PQC traffic. Furthermore, software-only DPI CPU costs increase significantly, and legacy IDS/IPS signatures cannot parse hybrid KEM codepoints.

### The Key Takeaway

Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) Identity Providers are the highest priority for migration, as a compromised IdP invalidates all access. Network teams must immediately plan for 35ms inspection latency overhead and evaluate vendor PQC roadmaps before deploying hybrid traffic across inline security boundaries.

### What's Happening

Firewall and DPI appliance vendors are releasing firmware updates to handle larger PQC certificate chains, while network teams are testing hybrid TLS deployments and recalibrating inspection latency baselines to accommodate the increased processing overhead of quantum-safe traffic.
