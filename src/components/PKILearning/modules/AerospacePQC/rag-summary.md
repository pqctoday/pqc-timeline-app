# Aerospace PQC — Module Summary

## Overview

Advanced-level module (120 min, 6 workshop steps) covering post-quantum cryptography migration for the aerospace and space industries — environments with extreme bandwidth constraints, multi-decade asset lifetimes, mandatory re-certification requirements, and export-control implications for cryptographic algorithm changes.

## Key Topics

- **Avionics protocols and crypto constraints**: ARINC 429 (12.5 Kbps, 1960s legacy, 32-bit/4-byte data word — PQC signatures physically impossible on-wire), ARINC 664/AFDX (100 Mbps Ethernet, ML-DSA overhead manageable with proper framing), MIL-STD-1553 (1 Mbps, strict deterministic latency, real-time command/response), EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) TLS connections, ACARS (very limited bandwidth, 2400 bps VHF — PQC handshake infeasible)
- **Satellite orbit types and link budget impact**: LEO (500–2000 km, 90-minute orbit, ~20 ms one-way latency, Starlink/OneWeb/Planet Labs constellations, frequent handoffs complicate key freshness), MEO (GPS/Galileo orbits, 12-hour period, ~70 ms latency, high radiation exposure for onboard processors), GEO (35,786 km, 500 ms round-trip latency — significant impact on interactive key exchange protocols), HEO (Molniya orbits, 12-hour highly elliptical, ground segment complexity)
- **Certification and airworthiness**: DO-178C (airborne software, Design Assurance Levels DAL A through E — DAL A for flight-critical), DO-254 (complex electronic hardware design assurance), DO-326A (airworthiness security process), EUROCAE ED-202A (airworthiness security methods and considerations), AS9100D (aerospace quality management). Every cryptographic algorithm change that touches safety-critical software requires full DAL re-certification — potentially 3–7 years and tens of millions of dollars per aircraft type.
- **Export control**: ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) governs military avionics cryptography; EAR (Export Administration Regulations) governs dual-use. Standard encryption may qualify as EAR99 (no license required) or fall under ECCN 5E002. ML-DSA export classification under BIS review as of early 2026 — classification pending formal ruling. Wassenaar Arrangement cryptography controls apply to international aircraft programs.
- **Fleet interoperability and mixed-generation aircraft**: Legacy aircraft with ARINC 429 buses alongside modern AFDX-equipped platforms create heterogeneous ground-to-air upgrade paths; hybrid TLS sessions required at ACARS/VDL ground stations; timeline for fleet-wide PQC migration spans 20+ years given aircraft service lives.
- **Radiation-hardened processor constraints**: Space-qualified rad-hard processors (e.g., GR712RC LEON3FT, RAD750) have limited crypto acceleration, clock speeds typically 50–200 MHz — software ML-DSA verification at these speeds requires careful profiling; dedicated crypto coprocessors (e.g., RTAX-S FPGA) needed for real-time signing.
- **HNDL risk for satellite telemetry**: Satellite lifetime of 15–20 years (GEO) to 5–7 years (LEO) means telemetry and command links encrypted today are HNDL-exposed. Command uplinks (telecommand) authenticated with RSA or ECDSA are the highest-risk assets — spoofed commands could cause mission loss.
- **Algorithm recommendations by constraint tier**: ML-DSA-44 for signature-constrained avionics with adequate compute, ML-KEM-768 for key exchange over AFDX/Ethernet links, FN-DSA-512 (FALCON-512, ~690-byte signature) for ultra-constrained processors where ML-DSA-44's 2,420-byte signature is too large for protocol framing.

## Workshop Steps

1. **AvionicsProtocolAnalyzer** — Compare ARINC 429, ARINC 664/AFDX, MIL-STD-1553, ACARS, and EFB by bandwidth, latency budget, message size limit, and PQC feasibility; visualize where each algorithm fits or fails
2. **SatelliteLinkBudgetCalculator** — Compute PQC handshake overhead as percentage of link budget across LEO/MEO/GEO/HEO orbits; model key refresh intervals vs pass duration for LEO
3. **CertificationImpactAnalyzer** — Map algorithm changes against DO-178C DAL levels; estimate re-certification scope, cost, and timeline per aircraft type; identify which changes require full vs partial re-certification
4. **FleetInteroperabilityMatrix** — Model mixed-generation fleet scenarios (legacy ARINC 429 + modern AFDX + ground systems); design hybrid protocol upgrade paths for ACARS ground station TLS sessions
5. **ExportControlClassifier** — Classify cryptographic changes against ITAR/EAR/Wassenaar; identify license requirements for international programs; flag ML-DSA pending classification status
6. **MissionCryptoLifecyclePlanner** — Plan end-to-end PQC migration for a spacecraft mission: launch crypto (RSA → ML-DSA), telecommand authentication, telemetry encryption, ground station key management, mission lifetime key rotation schedule

## Key Data Points

- ARINC 429 data word: 32 bits (4 bytes) — ML-DSA-44 signature (2,420 bytes) is 605× the word size; PQC infeasible on-wire, must use out-of-band key distribution
- ARINC 664/AFDX frame: up to 1,518 bytes Ethernet MTU — ML-KEM-768 ciphertext (1,088 bytes) fits within a single frame
- MIL-STD-1553 message: up to 32 data words (64 bytes) — PQC signature transport requires multi-frame fragmentation protocol
- ML-DSA-44: public key 1,312 bytes, signature 2,420 bytes — baseline for signature-capable avionics
- ML-DSA-65: public key 1,952 bytes, signature 3,309 bytes — for ground segment and EFB where bandwidth allows
- FN-DSA-512 (FALCON-512): public key 897 bytes, signature ~690 bytes — preferred for constrained onboard processors
- ML-KEM-768: public key 1,184 bytes, ciphertext 1,088 bytes — key exchange for AFDX/Ethernet-connected subsystems
- GEO round-trip latency 500 ms — IKEv2 with ML-KEM adds ~3 extra round trips vs classical ECDH, potential 1.5 s additional latency per session establishment
- LEO pass duration: typically 8–12 minutes for a ground station — key session must be established and torn down within pass window
- DO-178C DAL A re-certification: estimated $10M–$50M per aircraft type for cryptographic algorithm changes in flight-critical software
- Spacecraft lifetime HNDL exposure: GEO satellites launched 2026 with RSA-2048 telecommand auth remain exposed through ~2046 — well within projected CRQC window
