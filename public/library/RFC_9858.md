_RFC 9858 Additional HSS/LMS Signatures October 2025 Fluhrer & Dang Informational [Page] Stream: Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) RFC: 9858 Category: Informational Published: October 2025 ISSN: 2070-1721 Authors: S. Fluhrer Cisco Systems Q. Dang NIST RFC 9858 Additional Parameter Sets for HSS/LMS Hash-Based Signatures Abstract This document extends HSS/LMS (RFC 8554) by defining parameter sets that use alternative hash functions. These include hash functions that result in signatures with significantly smaller sizes than the signatures that use the RFC 8554 parameter sets and should have sufficient security. ¶ This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).
